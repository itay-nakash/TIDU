416_2_3,"obligatory ""this didnt happen today""

a few years ago i, being the dumb horny virgin i had been, was trying to find something to help me relieve myself, but having become bored of watching porn all the time i wanted to find a real chick. so i set out upon the many chat sites of the internet, found a girl on omegle and we immediately kicked it off. we seemed to have the same problem and decided we should move off omegle to skype. as soon as we were connected i started getting undressed and the girl on the cam started to as well and was asking for close ups of my dick. obviously, i obliged and about five minutes later her cam changes to show me handling my junk. 

confused, i ask what's going on and they tell me if i don't pay them a couple hundred bucks this recording was going to all my friends and family(my full name was on my skype), and being broke as i was i started freaking out and trying to convince them of my being penniless but they wouldn't have it and started a countdown. freaking out even more, i summoned all the courage i had and told my dad what had happened, and he tells me to call the police about it. so i call the cops and a couple minutes later one is in our living room taking down what had happened. 

oh yeah, i told the scammer i called the cops after being told to do so by my dad and they promptly stopped the countdown and disappeared, but with a policeman there i had to explain why he had been sent to my house. praise be to this man that he did not laugh at the stupid thing i had done. he told me i should call the fbi as the skype account they used had an address on it and apparently this was quite common, but they never found out who it was so i didnt have to go to court to testify or anything.

i havent used omegle once in those years and dont plan on doing so for sexual reasons again, if at all.",4

204_2_2,"to picture in your mind because i hate when posts do not clarify if the user who f'd up is a boy or girl, and you have to find out later or there possibly gay, it just totally fucks up the story i place in my mind of these hilarious tifu's. so i am a college aged, young man. i today i fucked up with multiple things. i forgot to set my fucking alarm clock last night so i woke up 50 minutes late for work. literally slab a toothbrush in my work bag and get out the door half naked. turn on my car, to see it was below ""e"", and there is just no way in hell i will make it 25 miles to my shit dung job of telemarketing. i've been a little sick lately so half way there as i merge onto the turnpike i roll down my window to spit out some mucus that has been building up. no i did not make it out the window, in fact for the second time it landed literally directly in my car, a big glob of yellow mucus, that looked like hydrogenated goats piss mixed with dolphins seamen. this is when it happened. i feel rumbling in my belly, still on the highway, and i casually fart, just once. it was such a hot temperatured fart i had to drive while squatting above my seat so the fart could disarray into the air. bad because my a/c shot it right up my nose to shave off all my nose hairs and i probably now have lung cancer because of it. this happened probably ten times before work. it smelt like fucking shit, i'm late for work, fuck. time to annoy random people on the phone, i'm such a smelly bastard  right now.",4
350_2_3,"near the end of november i had ordered some things for christmas and had them shipped to my grandmothers to prevent my family members from seeing what i had gotten them. 


fast forward a few weeks and she's having a christmas party for people at the state house, her place of work, and for the future speaker of the house. there were also a lot of state reps, and people of high interest there who had brought their families, so we were told to act our best. after the party had started moving into the main room, we decided to go into one of the back room closets where the items i had ordered were put so they wouldn't get in the way of the party. trying to keep it hidden from the rest of my family members, we went into the closet, closing the doors and locking them. (the inside of the closet has a lock inside of it.) now, this is a fairly large closet, but it's packed pretty full with packaging for the holiday decor, so it's a bit cramped.


unknown to the three of us, my grandmother had decided to give a tour to one of her friends who had yet to see her newer place. eventually, they came to the locked closet and and tried open it, so my friend decided to open the door to the closet. my grandmother introduces her ""grandson and his two friends"" to the former president of a major east coast university.(can i mention his name and the university?) it took us about a half hour to realize what had happened, and how extremely awkward and odd it seemed. he remembered our names, but i'm not sure if that's really something to be proud of.",2
189_2_2,"the tire pressure monitor went off while me and peaches (my corgi) where going to the store. stopped at the nearest parking lot, got out walked around to the passenger side, check the tire. its good. must be the sensor. come back to the driver door. its locked. with my phone, wallet, and my precious baby corgi all inside. don't panic. should i break the window? which one should i break? its a few miles hike home to get my spare key, and hopefully get a ride. i weight my options. truck is running, with a/c going, peaches will be ok assuming someone doesn't break the window and steal my truck and her. its not the greatest neighborhood around here. tie my shoes tighter, take my shirt off, and start the 3.3 mile run home in 104 degree heat. that was the last 60 minutes of my life.

during my 5k run home, i had plenty of time to re-think how this could have happened. i troubleshoot technical issues all day at work, so i put those skills to use. i came to the conclusion that the only way this was possible is that my corgi peaches, must have hit the manual lock with her paw. 

made it home, got my keys and a ride back to the truck, peaches was happy and cool in the a/c. i'll be deploying counter measures to prevent this from ever happening again..",2

51_2_1,"as the title says, i fucked up using fb, but there's a little more to it than that.



so, from time to time, i dig through my friends facebook friends list, which leads me to another person, and so on, until i get to a person that i want to.....facebook stalk. just a little....not often at all. 

it is my ex's now husband i look at....just to, i don't know, torture myself, or to see if their life is good or not. (it is, but so is everyone's on fb i guess)


being older i should know better than to do this childish shit, but i get bored sometimes, maybe a little sad, perhaps hungry, possibly a bit drunk, and i start digging.

well, lo and behold  i took a trip down memory lane, through sadville boulevard, and ended up in terrorville, as i discovered that the button next to his name was not blue with the normal words, ""send request"", but it was white with, ""request sent"" next to it.


literally a feeling of shock and horror overcame me. her and i did not have a pleasant ending to our relationship (my fault mostly), and i highly doubt the request was looked upon in a pleasant light. i now feel like a jackass.....a total jackass. i do not remember the last time i looked him up, but either way i'm sure he saw i sent that request. 


i ended up taking the request back, as well as blocking him. i did this for 2 reasons.....a: hopefully it gives the impression that i did not mean to send that, and i am no threat, and b: i don't ever want to see that page on the interwebs ever again.",2

so i'm the kind of person that needs like 4 alarms to wake-up, occasionally more. trying to get up for an early class was a struggle, so i thought, ""hey this rooster alarm seems obnoxious and loud, maybe it will work.""

what i didn't account for was my cat. alarm goes off at 7am and my phone is promptly attacked by a demented 3-legged feline, intent of the destruction of the ""bird"". i spend a good minute trying to a) wake-up, b) get my phone without getting clawed, and c) turn off that damn alarm. needless to say. i didn't use that one any more. it woke me up, but was not worth it. not at all.",1
390_2_3,"i'm not sure if there's a sub to submit other people's fuck-ups, but i just witnessed this happen to a friend of mine(we'll call him moe). the next paragraph is from his pov just for context:

*so fuckupsnitch and another friend(we'll call him bart) wanted to meet me at the mall this evening. i just happened to be nearby and decide to wait at starbucks making it a great rendezvous point. as i devour a panini, i stare at a blank space at the wall and get lost in a sea of nothingness. i dare not blink and my eyes are fixated at this point. i see and hear nothing. it's just the panini and me. all of a sudden, i'm violently shook by a man.*

back to me(not moe). 

at this point, i walk up to the starbucks with my mate and see our panini devouring buddy sat at a table, staring directly across with a rather angry saudi man standing next to him. we notice his gaze is fixed. his body and head may be moving, but his eyes haven't. as he snaps out of his trance, the saudi man takes off one of his slippers and starts beating our friend with it. bart and i burst out laughing. moe's always getting himself into trouble. we wonder what he's done. we walk up to the table to try to calm down a livid saudi man, and then we hear moe say ""but sir, really, i don't even like boobs. i would never! i'm not that kind of guy"" this went on back and forth, moe ended up explaining to the rest of the patrons at the starbucks that he really wasn't a pervert and we were asked to leave otherwise they would inform the authorities.

turns out, moe was so lost in his own world, he failed to notice the saudi family sit at the table right there and he failed to notice how uncomfortable he was making the woman by staring right at her chest and failed to notice the saudi man repeatedly warning him to stop.",1
202_2_2,"long time lurker first time poster here, and yes this did indeed happen today, about 2 hours ago in fact.

  so i work nights at costco as a forklift driver part time.  we're usually understaffed and everyone is usually in a rush to get everything done in time (we have some dumb rule about no overtime).  

  i was emptying one of our storage trucks and as i turned a corner to get to where the stack of products should be put, the stack i was carrying (outdoor solar powered lights) started to tip, but not fall over.  as i drove further down the aisle, it felt like there was nothing on my forks.  i looked over and saw the stack slowly tipping over, and finally crash into the cooler where all the meat is kept.  (it's a single deck meat case for clarification)  

  the solar lights bent the frame that the dual paned glass is in and shattered all of the glass.  we had to get rid of all the meat in the meat case due to potentially dangerous glass shards (unable to see with the naked eye) hurting the customers.  

  it was approximately $5000 worth of meat that has to get thrown out and another $2000 to fix the meat case.  thankfully i'm not the one who has to shell out the money to fix all of this, but it kind of sucks to know that i'll be walking by a damaged meat case every day knowing it was i who damaged it.",3
188_2_2,"this didn't happen today, but it happened back when i was a freshman in high school maybe about 4 years ago. 
while my dad was on his second tour in afghanistan, my mom decided to take my little sister to the philippines to visit some relatives, leaving my brother and i by ourselves at home.

one late night, after browsing through endless youtube videos, i came across a video that pranked people on chatroulette by appearing as a famous celebrity such as justin bieber or drake. 
i figured out how to do it and made it so i appeared as wiz khalifa smoking on my webcam. after getting numerous hilarious reactions, i decided to call it a night.

i woke up the next morning and my dad ended up calling me through skype. i had forgotten the fact that i still had the video of wiz on my video feed and answered the video call with my dad. the video had no audio and my audio input was turned off so  i couldn't tell my dad it was fake. i tried switching it back during the call but he quickly hung up. i tried calling back but he didn't answer. i was freaking out at this point. 

he ended up calling my older sister at work and letting her know what's going on. he assumed that a random black guy, ""wiz khalifa"" had broken into our house and is smoking weed in our office. 
my older sister called me and asked me what the hell is going on. i explained to her and she told me that my uncle (retired cop) is on his way with a unit from the police station to check up on the house. 
i called my uncle and told him what was going on and then finally received a call from my dad.

53_2_1,"this fuck up happened around november to december of 2014, but it started around august of that same year. i had just started my senior year of high school, 17yo male and was feeling pretty good at the time. i had never had a relationship prior to this encounter, and i can't remember how exactly we met each other rather than having heard that a junior girl had taken interest in me. now, this came as quite the surprise, considering the fact that i was a skinny white kid that was not only incredibly introverted, but also a little bit socially awkward with very little self-confidence.

anyway, one day we started talking, one thing led to another, and we were eventually dating. (oh yes, high school dating). so, the relationship seemed to progress as normal (or at least what i assumed to be normal, based on the fact that i never had a prior relationship up to that point in my life). well, one night, we we're over at my house watching a movie and ended up starting to kiss, and then proceeded to cuddle. it was during that point in which i took the time to say ""i love you"", and she seemed fine with it at the time and said it back.

now remember, i'm a socially awkward introvert with no prior dating experience. the only reason i said that was because of the fact that i wanted to show her that i appreciated her taking interest in me and spending time with, being with me, caring about me.

well, in about 1 months time this relationship continued, nothing seemed out of the ordinary, and then the day that finals ended and i was searching for the perfect christmas present on etsy, (which was this really neat handmade bracelet with polymer clay animals), she texted me saying that she needed to stop over and it would only take a minute. then she dumped me, with no explanation other than that she didn't feel comfortable that i told her i loved her, despite that she never communicated this with me. so there i was, christmas approaching, feeling heartbroken, alone, and depressed. i mean, looking back, at least i passed all my exams with flying colors. so i had that going for me, which is nice.",1

i am not a hunter. i have never prepared deer meat. however i love to grill and i love food. it was completely random but around christmas time my parents offered me a deer steak just because. 

it had been sitting in my freezer for quite some time just wrapped in paper and i decided now is the time, let’s defrost this and grill it. so last night i took out the steak put it in the fridge and went to bed. i woke up today and went to work waiting for my delicious steak to defrost.

well when i came home and opened the fridge it looked like freddy krueger had a field day in my fridge. apparently when deer defrosts it bleeds aggressively, like alot. i had about a cup of deer blood in the form of a puddle in my fridge leaking all over the shelves and food and had to clean my halloween themed fridge full of deer blood.",2

379_2_3,"so this isn't a 1 day fuck up but instead several weeks worth.

i am going to be brief with certain events here because i made a promise to z not to tell anyone what happened and as you will soon understand, it is safer if it just stays hidden. for the same reasons, i have used a thowaway.

a few weeks ago i got a call from a particularly drunken and high z who wanted to do themselves in so i spent that night making sure they were okay. despite some very weird goings on where they were angrily responding to comments that no one had said. due to their unhealthy state.

after that night, everything was perfectly fine until 3 weeks later when this sentence was said ""i will always appreciate you. you are one of the best people i know... i fucking hate you! you are a prick. i hope you die!"" and they ran off. now nothing happened between the two things and i hadn't even had a chance to respond to the first comment.

over the next few days people started learning why she suddenly hated me. when i eventually found out what the story is, i can assure you that it is a very alternative take on what i did that evening. but it does tie in with the ""weird goings on"" i mentioned. now because of the way they have been acting it would appear that they believe this completely so i just tried to ignore everything as much as possible and leave it alone. but after a few too many comments, i said ""i am not going to go into what happened but you can guarantee it didn't happen that way. i don't know why they are saying it, maybe it is because of the alcohol."" i decided not go into the details because i know that that would be better for z. and i am beginning to realise that i can handle this better than they would.

well this got back to z didn't it. now z, along with family and friends is wanting to finish me off for chatting shit.",2

so we enjoy our indian food and have ordered from the same place a whole bunch of times. we usually order the same dish each time because we enjoy it, so as usual i order our food, my wife gets the chicken korma a nice creamy dish and i order a chicken in coconut sauce. now its important to point out her dish is usually pretty pale due to its creamy nature and my dish is usually pretty red because of the spices used.

fast forward to it being delivered before she came home from work, i decided to get everything set up so she can come right through the door and start eating. so the food is ready and she isnt home, so i decide to tuck in and start eating. she walks through the door and im almost done and she looks at my plate and there hers and asks me why i was eating her food? i explained ""sweetheart this is the dish i usually get and eat?"" she was adamant i was eating her food! so much so she went straight to bed. she hasnt spoken to me since haha, i still cant believe it! must be her pregnant brain :d",2

220_2_2,"so this actually happened this morning before work. i've been staying at my parent's house since my dad has been sick. we've been trying to keep an eye on him. in the guest room there is my old bunk bed and a futon; for a while, id been sleeping on the futon because i'm 26 and felt like i was too old to use a bunk bed. that lasted about two weeks, or until last night, when i decided that i'm old enough to not care if i'm childish sometimes lol. so i slept on the bunk bed, and of course, it had to be the top bunk. my parents live in a small place so the bed nearly reaches the ceiling anyway. slept like a baby. my alarm scared the shit out of me when it went off and i jumped up like usual, hitting my head full force on the damn ceiling. like a five-year-old who just had their toy taken from them, i screamed for my mom immediately. i hear her running up the steps and i'm still a little fuzzy; she tries to open the door but my shit is all over the place and its not budging. starting to realize i'm fine and not five, i shout that i'm fine but its too late. she pushes the door open with all her might and it gets stuck on some clothes; she trips and hits her head on the steel bars of the bed and now i feel like shit because of it. she's holding back tears and rubbing her head while asking if i'm okay, i tell her i'm fine and am apologizing like crazy. then my dumbass tries to get off the bed and misses the bar causing me to do a split...i'm not flexible at all. so now i'm shouting obscenities and i cant tell if she's laughing or crying. eventually, i got down and everyone was fine. the day was decidedly spent (by my mom) sitting in the living room and talking about how i've always been clumsy and she finds it hilarious. i really can't wait to just go back home to my apartment and pretend this never happened.",2

219_2_2,"before i went to work last week, i found something at my door on the way out to rage upon the dreaded miserable day ahead known as monday. upon opening said door, i found a beautiful pink and tinsel christmas wreath with five colored ornaments attached directly on the ground in front of it. one actually fell off and required re-hooking after my door had knocked it over.

i looked around and did not see any other christmas wreaths, but seeing as i just moved in, i figured my lovely apartment building must have given me a holiday gift. note: they also gave me a goody bag upon move-in in october, and the security staff all love me. clearly i'm worthy of a free christmas wreath!

fast forward to a week later--a sunday. i heard a lot of knocking and chatter on doors throughout the evening with much confusion and wondered what was up. then i heard talking outside my door. ""maybe we should just leave a note and ask.""

knock knock knock

i answer. a neighbor and her boyfriend were there. i had met several times prior (they actually gave me a free sam adams mug once, i believe. they won it at an event and the bf didn't want to bring it back to baltimore.

the woman asked if i had seen any christmas wreaths around. i told her what happened. then she replied.

""so ya'll don't have it then?""

""no, i'm saying i do have it. you want it back?""

""oh. yes, please!""

""awww. well, you've ruined christmas for everyone!""

i went and got her the wreath, handed it over, and she and the boyfriend looked pleased, if not bemused. i feel they actually believed me, but today i fucked up...by stealing christmas decorations from neighbors.

what i don't understand is how it actually got there. our doors are literally 15 feet apart. we think it fell off and a cleaning lady moved it to my door.",1

finally, after two months since it was scheduled, my test was today. the test wasn't until four, so i spent the whole day checking and rechecking that everything was perfect. i went over everything twice with my mom, just to be certain. at three o'clock, she and i hopped into my sister's car - mine has a wonky speedometer - and drove to the dmv.

we spent an hour and half waiting for the instructor. in that time, my paperwork was processed and approved. everyone was so kind and trying to help me relax. i was finally called for the vehicle inspection, so out we went.

she asked for the car's insurance card. i got it out and handed it to her, all while exchanging small talk. suddenly she frowns and says it's expired. by a week. shit. i searched for a newer one but the five that were in the car were from two years ago.

we were given five minutes (they close at five and the test would take 20 minutes) to email her the correct card. mom couldn't remember her password for the company's website and no other family member would pick up their phones.

i was told the next opening wasn't until june 27th. i went out to the car to cry, and apparently another employee recognized me and explained to the instructor how many times i've been trying for this. she made an opening for me early on tuesday morning.

what really pissed me off was that the card was only effective for nine days... if only i had checked.",3

404_2_3,"this just happened and i'm still recovering.

alright, so i'm a teenage boy who is coming to the end of my 3-week family vacation. because of this, i haven't really had the time to masturbate, a ritual i perform all to often. so grabbing the best opportunity i feign needing to get something from the room and leave the rest of my family to their sunbathing. 

i get to the room and awake the one-eyed snake. the lack of masturbating for almost 3 weeks has taken it's toll and i end up finishing quickly and making quite a mess. in my post-wank madness i decide it would be a good idea to go for round two, considering i've missed valuable time over the last few weeks. after round two (which is considerably longer and dryer than round one), i notice a bit of a cut at the top of my johnny rocket, but i write it off, i've dealt with worse and i can deal with this.

fast forward to a few hours later, and my family decides to head over to the beach for a swim, to which i begrudgingly oblige, forgetting my 'injury'. as i step into the sea water, all seems fine, until i realise my fatal mistake. at first a tiny papercut on my finger starts to sting, but this is nothing compared to the pain that is about to come. it takes about 2 minutes before the tingling starts. the tingling turns into a stinging and the stinging turns into a severe pain. i bolt out of the water, grab a towel and run back to the hotel. i'm now sitting on a deck chair, with my knob throbbing, wondering how the hell i'm going to explain my sudden disappearance.",3

last night i was sitting at home when there was a knock at the door. it was the neighbour, dropping off a box of chocolates to thank us for looking after their dog for the past week. i took the box, a bit confused, thanked him, and shut the door.

my partner turned to me with a look of dread on his face. turns out the neighbour had asked him last weekend to feed and water their dog for the upcoming week while they were on holidays. and my partner forgot about it almost the very second they asked him.

the dog is fine, but it very possibly could have been a much sadder ending. my partner is actually the worst person in the world, and we now have a box of chocolates that taste like guilt.

 

update: spoke to the neighbour and explained what happened, he was really understanding about it all. the dog is an outdoor cattle dog, and both his food and water bowls were filled before the family left, so turns out he didn't starve, and is the same happy, healthy, playful self. we have our own dogs, and it's heartbreaking to both of us what could have happened, but fortunately no harm done.",1

417_2_3,"well it was actually earlier this month and it was maybe a bit more my mum fucking up. 

so my family and me had gone on holiday to germany to visit my uncle's new house which he has just finished renovating. 

one day he was out at work and we were in his house with his girlfriend. suddenly my mum screams and we all go over and there's this big green bug. i kind of walk away once i realise it's not anything major and leave everyone else to it. 

i then see my uncle's girlfriend go into a drawer in the kitchen and bring out a bottle of pepper spray (it's probably good to mention that we live in the uk and pepper spray is illegal there so we hadn't ever seen it before). she then goes upstairs and hands the bottle to my mum. 

i follow and start to think this might not be a great idea. anyway, the bug was on the stairs and we were all at the bottom except for my mum who was closer to the top near the bug. she then points it at the bug and sprays. 

as it turns out, pepper spray is red and all the walls were white. when she sprayed it, it was like paint being sprayed on the wall. it was red and went quite a bit on the wall.

we then all realised we had made a big mistake. as we start talking about what to do we all start to cough violently. pepper spray can also travel through the air. we all run down to the ground floor and think we have escaped the air. for a while, it held true. approximately 30 seconds. we then had to open all the doors and windows and we were coughing and our eyes were starting to stream. 

it eventually cleared out of the air and the stain mostly washed away but not completely. we never told my uncle but it's a good thing his eyesight isn't great so he'll probably never see it.",1
362_2_3,"first time poster. this actually happened friday but just now thought of posting it. my grammar skills are lacking so bare with me.

so to start i have three best friends. not going to name names but we have been friends through previous family connections for years. my mates birthday was friday and we bought alcohol as we have done for the rest of our birthdays this year. (we all turned the legal drinking age this year.) once we we're sufficiently stocked we headed back home to reminisce about stories of the past. a few hours and half a litre of alcohol later is where i can no longer tell the story from my point of view. according to my friends i collapsed. being inebriated they panick and load me into their car. they drove down the road open the door and push me out infront of a house. as i lay on the lawn the owners of the home noticed i was lying in their yard. not sure if i was alive or dead they called 911 immediately. i was then rushed to hospital and immediately put on a ventelator. the hanting detail is at 2 am my mom had text me asking when im coming home. two minutes before i was thought to be in a coma by hospital staff. i cant say what else happened until the time i woke up at 5:36 am. later my mother told me i was 1-2 drinks away from slipping into a coma as my bac was a 0.36. the reason i posted this was to warn people to drink responsibility. i didnt even feel too drunk during this time. remember how precious life is.

i met my girlfriend while i was in the hospital. she is the prettiest and most caring nurse in the physical rehabilitation ward and, to my knowledge, the world. she also had a dark and hidden ""freaky"" side. 
this freaky side manifested itself when we began our sexual relationship. it 's awesome.
it culminated yesterday when we were getting into the nasty. out of nowhere she roars at me in a demonic satanic influenced voice, ""use your fucking stump!!!!""
""my stump?!?!"" i asked incredulously.
she replied in the sweetest angelic voice, ""yes"".
at this point i was unnerved by the dichotomy of angels and demons fighting for her soul so i obliged. 
i lubed the shit out of my stump and started pushing in. she was irritated by my slow pace and pushed me onto my back. she got on top and as she was pushing down on my empire state building of a stump she let out a blood curdling scream. she immediately said we need to go to the hospital. thankfully, i live right next to the hospital. my school is right next to it. i teach english in korea.

so i checked on my university's website to tell him the dates. after a long few scrolls, i ended up on my subject's timings and found that the two subjects share the same date except in the timing department one is after the other. i twist my head gradually to the bottom right corner of the monitor to find the current date & time. turns out it was the same exact date. i try to reason with myself that this was an error in the system or no one puts exams on weekend but i remembered that the last few semesters had exams on a saturday. that's when i started to panic and sob uncontrollably knowing i missed the two exams. 

even if i had fever i would never miss exams let alone a test. i tried everything from getting a fake sick leave to coming up with a letter suggesting i wasn't mentally stable to write the papers. unfortunately, none of these worked.",4

i excuse myself from the table and sit on the can. not a second later the brown waterfall begins splashing into the water, accompanied by sounds which i never thought my stimach would be capable of making. this continued for roughly 25 minutes, with short pauses in between the torrential shitstorms. i could hear the sounds of fidgeting and discomfort coming from the other room, and by the end i felt embarrassed but extremely relieved.

bit of background i'm a bit of a gamer and got windows 10 free upgrade deal with it seeing as i had minecraft pc already i got the windows 10 beta thing. 

this starts with me getting a code for the beta from a mac user so a friend can have a game that we can play (long story with that so wont go into details here may do in comments) so after giving the code i try to open the xbox app in hopes of finding my friends xbox id (so we can do multiplayer) fastforward slightly, this is after me trying to force the xbox app to log out and log in again, im in a remote service session with microsoft support, they try everything from refreshing the windows store to reinstalling the xbox app nothing works so then they go to start a windows re-imaging process (basically reinstalling the os) before they get chance to do anything they get disconnected, i wait about 10-20 mins letting my net settle because wi-fi for me can be funny, nothing. i end up having to make sure they cant re-connect because i have to go to a friends to do some minecraft recording (modded minecraft not windows 10 edition).

yesterday i reinstalled windows 10 from the image i made myself a few days prior, thinking that it would be the pro edition i thought nothing of it, did a few things around the house while it was installing and updating got back and realised it was the home edition, at first i thought nothing of it tried to do some modded minecraft and it ran at what felt like negative frames per second. thought something was up and found out that home couldn't give enough ram for what i was needing so i ended up reinstalling windows 7 ultimate to get it to windows 10 pro (via free upgrade thing) but that produced problems because i didnt have a product key that would work (i used to run windows loader to get the keys to work and used it to install windows 7 on friends and families machines) thankfully i found a windows 10 disc that has pro on and ended up using that.

386_2_3,"always wanted to post something here and this was technically today so i'm sort of happy? 

basically, i went to my friend's house for easter who has polish heritage (i'm british). he wasn't actually there as he has moved to australia, but i'm just as good friends with this guy's cousin so i was invited anyway as we get along like a house on fire. (weird saying, huh?) anyway, met the family and some new friends and had a good time. 

now, it turns out there was a plan to get me initiated as it was my first polish easter. basically at midnight on the sunday night/monday morning, they throw water over everybody. so at midnight, everybody got a mug of water and waited to throw it at me as i was the newbie. we were already standing outside chatting and i had no clue what was going on, i thought they were just getting a drink. at midnight, they all threw it at once. i was soaked. pretty funny though!

anyway, that's not the fuck up. as i didn't know and i hadn't wet anybody myself, one of the guys who i've met a few times before said i could throw water at him as he was last for this to happen to on a previous year and he wanted me to be involved. so i was given a mug of water and i threw it at him. however, my hand was wet from being soaked and i wasn't holding the mug by the handle. so i ended up throwing the whole fucking mug by accident. the shot was perfect. for his face. fuck. bruise on his nose. 

he was a bit startled but took it well though. he said it and he was okay, and i apologised profusely but everyone said don't worry, it's a new story to tell people. he might have a headache this morning though... 

in case you were worried about the mug, it didn't break. it fell straight on to concrete and somehow just rolled... crazy physics.

so last friday, i had to take him to work. as usual, i had about 5 minutes to get him there due to him dragging his feet getting ready. everything goes smoothly until i get to the turn for the street where his work is. it was a green light but no green arrow. there's a car in front of me, pulled up and waiting to turn, so i pull up behind them. the oncoming traffic stops to let people turn. guy in front of me turns, so i stupidly follow behind and just as i'm nearly around the corner, dude comes up the left hand oncoming lane and thumps me in the left headlight.

yay first accident. now i'm on the hook for maybe over $1000 (find out tomorrow how much the other guy is quoted for fixing his panels. i'm hoping that because he came away with mostly scratches on the front and a couple of slightly popped panels that he put back in place before he left, it'll be cheap.)

so i had just gotten out of the family pool, and i was in the garage drying myself off. it was rather warm in the garage, made even hotter by the 105° f heat. i apparently wasn't warm enough, however, because when i spotted a steel gasoline canister in the corner of our garage, i wanted to see if it would spew flames. 
so, i pick up the canister, find a lighter that was in a toolbox, and turn the can upside-down. i then proceeded to light the lighter to the air displacement hole(having closed the pouring hole), holding the can an inch from my face as i do so.

of course, the can then exploded with enough force to shake the neighbor's houses on both sides of the house.

my mother comes quickly into the garage with a look on her face that clearly states that she was expecting a splattered me on the floor.

wanna know how badly it injured me?
it simply singed my fingers. not burnt, singed. how is my face still intact? no idea. how did i not catch steel shrapnel to various parts of my body? you've got me. 

 the garage was on the far side of the neighbor's​ house who was home. he then came out and asked if a gas can exploded. that's right, he even knew exactly what had exploded. 

i was the luckiest person on the planet at that moment. 

what was i thinking? ""flamey flame whoosh whoosh"", not ""booooooooom"".

okay so i had an assignment draft due today. nothing big, just two pages but i decided i might as well staple it anyway, just in case it gets lost. 

i go to staple it and what do i find? my stapler is empty. no biggie, i'll just refill it. 

i go to close the stapler and my brilliant self thought it was a great idea to place my thumb where the staples come out. 

a few seconds later i feel a sharp pain on my thumb so i pull my hand away and with it comes the stapler. 

yes, friends. i stapled my thumb to the stapler. 

i lean over to my friend and quietly tell her that i have royally fucked myself and, being the good friend she is, she yells across the library to our teacher that i have stapled my thumb. 

my teacher comes over and immediately starts panicking because i have a stapler attached to my thumb. she sends my friend and another teacher with me to the nurse. 

half way there the stapler detaches itself but there is still a staple imbedded in my thumb. 

we get to the nurse and she starts laughing at the sheer  ridiculousness of the situation. she gives me a bandaid and some dettol and tells me to pull it out. 

i grab the staple and pull. immediately blood starts pouring out of the tiny holes because if how deep the staple had gone in. i wipe the blood away and put the bandaid on. 

the nurse gives me a note to show that i've been to her, on which she writes ""stapled finger"".  

i get back to my class and i glue the staple to the note because why not. then i decide to actually staple my assignment. i look through it to make sure everything is there and what do i find? the second page is blank. i didn't need to staple my assignment at all. 

this whole situation could have been avoided if i had just checked my work first.

having had a few many drinks i had decided that i was going to put this head on it's body and slap the statue around a bit. eventually that escalated to a point in which in my drunken stupor, thinking it would look cool, i proceeded to take the head outside and smash it on the pavement (a giant asshole and douchebag move on my part).

unbeknownst to me at the time however this statue was the property of my friend's roommate, and it turns out it was one of the few items handed down to him from his dad. i am not sure what it would be valued at in the market, but i know this guy values it highly and i ruined it. i now feel like the world's biggest asshole and tool, but want to try to find some way to make it up to the guy (if that is even possible). 

 

despite any restitution agreement the two of us come to, i would like to replace the head if at all possible so at the very least he can keep the statue on display. i would hope that between that and any other agreements we come to, he and his family can be at peace. i'm posting this here because i can't find anything on this statue and was wondering if anyone can here help me identify a replacement for the head in this [picture](http://imgur.com/qxztjgf).

a little background. me and my s.o have been seeing each other for the past few months. a large point of contention between us was the fact that we always used her parents car and it would be nice if i had one so we wouldn't always be reliant on her parents goodwill. i say point of contention to denote the on going tirade that is hurled my way whenever we go anywhere and we have to use her car, that basically makes an appearance in the form of a quip or jab 85% of the time we speak.
fast forward to a week ago. i purchased a decent winter car and am spending the bulk of my spare cash on getting it up to spec and insured. because of this we have not gone out in a few weeks. yesterday she called me at work and asked me to take her out for dinner. well more like told me to take her out to dinner. you can probably guess where this is headed.
i refused, saying that is would be better for me to stay in to make sure i could handle the first insurance payment for the vehicle and that we could meet up later that evening for a drink or later that week...

so i was on my living room sofa with louise and there was a knock at the door and it was the fucking police, so they come in ask all of us questions including my mum because apparently louise's mum reported her to the local police as a missing person and they found my adress from a letter i had written louise in her room. because her mum didnt know she was going to bristol today she got really pissed off and demanded louise go back to the north. so long story short she's on her way back home now with the police and i am devastated because my perfect weekend is ruined. i have full trust in louise and i know she didnt intentionally run away from home. i just want this to be sorted out.

i don't know what happens now but i'm just gonna shut myself away from everyone.",3
236_2_2,"i didn't get much sleep last night so i was pretty tired when i woke up this morning. i go to make myself a coffee and grab an bag of pre-ground coffee, i pour it into a double scoop group and make the coffee. 
further along the day i start getting more and more anxious and quite nauseous.when i get to work in the evening (fast food joint) i'm feeling really weird and pretty sick, as i'm working my hands are shaking all over like i've got parkinsons or something.
i'm feeling like shit by this point so i take a break and sit down at the back of the shop. right now i'm starting to lose feeling in my hands, legs and face and it's being replaced by this insane vibration. i feel like i'm going to fucking pass out. my whole body is oscillating and i think i'm going to die. [spoiler](/s""i don't"")
eventually my body stops vibrating, and after some water i settle down and take the night off. i still feel like i want to vomit but at least i'm not passed out. 

it turns out that i should have not only read the coffee packet for the *expiry date* but i should have also checked to see that it was really *instant coffee* (which you only really need use one teaspoon of, i probably had the equivalent of about 7 or 8 cups of coffee in one hit. my normal amount is about twice a month!)

 

edit: it was about the equivalent of around 10-12 cups apparently. the instant coffee was powder that you just put into hot water, it had about 50mg caffeine in less than a teaspoon of powder and the group holds around 10 teaspoons. so i'm guessing that was almost 0.5g or more of caffeine

98_2_1,"context: this was a few years ago in college. a few months prior, i had been kicked out of a 5 year relationship with a guy a few years older than me, who left me in a cruel way that left me a little fucked up. after much prodding from my roommate, i started going out to parties and such, with no intention of hooking up with anyone.
anyway, i'd been hanging out with a guy i thought was just a friend (i'd met his out-of-town gf a few times, and really liked her) at a mixer and got too drunk to get back to my place. i wasn't so drunk i couldn't remember, just too drunk to walk across campus alone at 3am.i ended up staying in his dorm that night-on the couch- no shenanigans happening whatsoever.  wake up the next morning, head back to my dorm like it's no big deal.

flash forward a year or so, i'm dating a great guy who happens to be in the same frat as the guy above. let's call him couch-guy. things are going great, we're seriously contemplating marriage. he knows the group of guys i hung out with and asks if anything has ever happened between any of them and me. i say 'no' because i don't count crashing on a guy's couch as a happening. bf then asks couch-guy the same thing, couch-guy says we made the secks. cue ""i can never trust you again"" breakdown from bf... and a lot of coaxing a reassurance from me that couch-guy is an asshole and a liar. i seriously contemplated telling couch-guy's gf all the girls i knew about that he did fuck, but decided to be the bigger person there... not sure if that was a good idea or not, but they're married now.

this morning in the shower i take a look down at mr. happy and he is not doing so well. i can only assume the face wash had some kind of anti-acne stuff in it because my dick kinda looks like a turkey gizzard. it is all flakey and dried out and the skin is papery like an old person's arm. hope my junk doesn't fall off.",3
99_2_1,"...needless to say, this particular device was gifted over to me over a year ago by a then-colleague. since we shared similar interests in novels, they left it set up under their account. 

today, i picked it up again and decided to purchase a book on unconventional relationships (which turned out to be a really good read!) as well as an adult novel. later on, i decided to lay down for a nap and woke up to a series of texts/calls from the previous owner.

it turns out that the previous owner and so share an account, so they (so) found the book charges and confronted the previous owner about it. everything had been left in tact, including the credit card information (which i had switched over to my information prior to purchase) but otherwise, i hadn't modified the account nor did i think to create my own. (thus, i totally deserved the shit storm that ensued.)

195_2_2,"on the eve of saturday, june the 28th, i was attending my boss's surprise party. on my tranquil walk of merry drink before hand, i had almost finished my first bottle of wine. upon leaving the gallant affair, i was two wine bottles deep, and say, 4-5 beers. all was good; jokes were made, laughs were had, and i arrived home safely. after one more [beer] for good measure, i was asleep in a haze of joyous bliss.

i awoke at the strike of one. however, it was not the clock which disturbed my slumber. unbeknownst to me, my twin had decided to host his brethren to a night of ale and wine. i stirred to the sound of familiar voices, and quickly resumed my perilous, drunken quest. 

as i had passed out on the couch, i woke to a band of muddled men, rambling aimlessly of the current eve's going-ons. i arose to retrieve another beer, but that was when i saw her. the gorgon-witch of nightmares. the ogress incarnate. she who goes bump in the night. 

and that was when my brother took her upstairs.

not long after, my brother returned to our first-floor encampment; a mixture of shame and success painted his face. his tormentor shortly followed suit. for whatever reason, we carried on as usual. drinking games ensued. and, as it turns out, i can be a very mean drunk. 

after having served her numerous cups of ""shut the fuck up"" and, ""how's a face-full of my brother's cum taste?"", i decided it was time to go to bed. i had work in a couple hours, after all. but that was when shit hit the fan. 

for god only knows why, after hours of verbal battery, she followed me to my chambers. i was reluctant at first, but soon my sleep-deprived, alcohol fueled mind took the reins, and anything was a go. yes, before long i was banging this grotesque monstrosity, who's girth i could only just circumvent with my arms, to an oblivion of orgasmic regret. i was also two hours late for work; but hey, fat chicks need love too, right?

til that nothing bonds a pair of brothers like porkin' the same hog.",2
103_2_1,"so i occasionally talk in my sleep, i usually find it pretty funny as i have (apparently) said some pretty hilarious stuff when i'm dreaming(including an amazing, panicked: ""i didn't do it... i didn't do it"" sleeping on a couch up at work once, made several people really worry ),  but this one was takes the cake. this happened last night.

so i fall asleep after my gf stood on my back (/drool i know, having your back stood on is like.. totes cray slammin). after a while i was quite rudely awoken to her on top of me,  smacking my face repeatedly demanding to know ""what's her name hmm?"".  according to her, i had started to cuddle up to her after i fell asleep while she was still watching bob's burger's. most of the time i hate cuddling because i'm like perpetually running hot, and her body heat a would just make me sweat so she was all giddy and excited that i was cuddling her without provocation. apparently shortly after that i started caressing her arm slowly and kind of pressing against her (hehe) and she's like always dtf so i bet she was enjoying that too... until suddenly (read hilariously) i said ""damn girl, i wish you were my girlfriend..."" (capitalization denoting sexy inflection). 

that's when she started slapping me... the ferocity of the sudden onslaught bewildered me at first, dashing any hope of me remembering even the smallest details of the fine dream honey i was probably about to get down with.  at first i tried to say that she can't be getting mad, she doesn't know what i was dreaming about, maybe i was dreaming about her and my dream self had just forgotten about our present relationship because i was dreaming from the perspective of my childhood self. she didn't believe it. 

eventually after i got done laughing stupid hard for a good 10 minutes or so i was just like... well shit, no way to cover this one up... ya i was probably totally just about to dream cheat on you babe, whoops sorry. she was pretty pissed..i think me laughing so hard at it made it better for the first few minutes (she started to laugh for a minute too)... then worse for the last few cuz she's still pretty salty.",2
54_2_1,"so  was a few months ago, but oh well.

at the time i had recently got a girlfriend, lets call her jess. she's 18 and i'm 20. both of us were virgins, so we started messing around pretty quickly into the relationship. 

at first we used bare skin condoms with no problems at all. my best friend, lets say andy, was stoked i lost my virginity finally that he agreed to surprise me with a box of his favorite condoms. 
""free condoms, can't go wrong there!"" i though with enthusiasm. well it went wrong there

the next day, jess and i decide to try the new ones. we start doing our this, wam bam thank ya mam, sexy time complete. the day after she notices when she goes to the bathroom, it hurts. since she still lives with her parents she tells them about the bathroom issue.

so her mom brings her to the doctor, jess tells her doctor (with her mom in the room) that she had sexual intercourse the day before. turns out the lube on the condoms caused the infection. the worst part is that her parents now know i deflowered their daughter within a month of dating her.

413_2_3,"background story: i'm 22 y.o. male home from school for winter break. a few weeks ago my brother came to visit with my 1 month old nieces. this was the first time they were at my house, and also the first time i was meeting them (my parents had already met them). of course, we took hundreds of pictures on a number of different cameras and phones. my mom wanted a consolidated folder for all of the pictures, so i suggested creating a dropbox shared folder for the pictures. i didn't have my computer at the moment so i used my mom's computer to import all of the pictures, then logged into dropbox through her browser and created a shared folder for the family. 

so, last night i walk upstairs and see my mom on her computer. i say hi to her but she doesn't respond and seems focused on the computer and annoyed/unhappy. i ignore it and go to the kitchen to make some food(10 feet away), when a few minutes later she tells me she thinks i accidentally left my dropbox logged in on her computer. oh shit, all my phone's pictures are automatically synced as soon as they are taken. she went to dropbox.com to log into her account to look at the baby pictures i shared, but i was still logged in. i ask how much she went through and she said not much, she was just looking for the baby pictures (the baby pics were towards te top). she lied...when i take the computer to log out i see she is all the way down to sept. 2011, and dropbox has the pictures in chronological order.

with a grimaced face she says, ""there are some things in there you should delete."" i have some pictures that she would not approve of to say the least. oh yeah, and i was just smoking in the basement 10 minutes earlier of which i happened to snap a nice selfie (would have been the first picture she saw). she also definitely knew i was just munching hard. sweet.",2

so were all happy to be back together all weekend and sunday turns immediately into an aggressive sunday-funday. grad school friend brings myself and another one of my friends around campus while the other part of the crew is re-upping at the liquor store.

its a beautiful campus, there's an amphitheater in a nice open area and, due to alcohol, we start using the amphitheater as a playground and start jumping around and just overall having a good time.

liquid confidence is very high at this point so i jump a gap in the amphitheater. nailed it. liquid confidence lvl: max. i see a trashcan near me among the same height as i am. so i go for it.

as i am flipping backwards and sideways, i realize that the trash can isn't bolted to the concrete square in the grassy area its standing on. i also realize its completely empty. i figure, if this goes bad i fall in the grass, say ow, and continue on with the day.

instead, i go straight right instead of any other direction, and meet the concrete sidewalk with the right side of my face, left wrist, and somehow sprained my left ankle.

i wake up and immediately notice that it's dark out and think that i slept all the way until the next morning. i still had homework to do so after checking my phone it was 5:46 i thought ""if i hurry i should be able to do my homework before school."" and start going into overdrive trying to get ready. i check in my closet and don't see any uniforms. i sprint downstairs still completely naked from sleep. as i'm sprinting downstairs i start to hear people talking and that's when any completely awake person would stop and think for a bit, not me apparently. before i could really even register it i was in my kitchen surrounded by my **extended family** completely naked.",2

one of these positions entails me laying across his chest in a sort of upside down 69. he decided to use the vibrator today. he's getting me close to climax and, since he knows i squirt sometimes, he was getting prepared for a possible onslaught of epic cum-portions. i start to climax and instead of cum, i squirt piss out onto his chest as i orgasm. i run into the bathroom to clean up as he lays on the bed laughing his dick off.

84_2_1,"well this tifu just happened literally 15 min ago. im typing it here because i think this tifu ultimately ended my relationship with my girlfriend and her family. dont worry there are no vulgar or nsfw material here. this is just about my ole dumb self being dumb as hell.

so basically, me and my girlfriend have been going out for 2 years now, and we've had a pretty rocky relationship until now but i love her and she loves me, but by now it should probably be ""loved"". so anyway, my girlfriend wanted to play some hearthstone together, for anyone who isnt familiar with hs, its a card game made by blizzard. so we planned to play it over a new app called discord instead of skype. discord is basically an application where you can communicate over the internet through text and mic just like skype but with better features and not as laggy as skype. on discord you are able to change the name of the different rooms you create. so being myself and wanting to have a nice laugh with my girlfriend, i made the room names suggestive towards my girlfriend's lady parts. this where my fuck up happens. so i made the room and everything, all i had to do now is message my girlfriend on hearthstone the link to my brand new room on discord called ""girlfriends ____hole"". i think you can figure out what the blank line could represent. so i messaged her saying that i made the room, sent her the link and told her to join ""girlfriends ____hole"", but this is where my stupidity hits. instead of messaging her, i accidentally messaged her brother. boom it hits me too late and i go full on panic mode. i messaged my girlfriend about this problem, (just to let you know her brother is pretty overprotective over her and doesn't like it when people objectify her) and she responded to me telling me she would talk to him etc. so she comes back to me and we had a pretty heated argument. ended on bad terms with her and possibly could have ended the relationship and making her brother think im a sex offender. sigh.

this was at the canadian border near niagara falls. it was a family vacation. we were crossing over through security and what not, showing our passports and whatever. it was heavily guarded as always. it didn't take as long as i thought it would but it was a little while. so we went outside and we were eating lunch or something i can't remember. but i was a curious little lad and i decided it would be a good idea to explore the building. i found one of those spiny door dances where you can enter but you can't get back in. i don't know why this was by a border to another country but whatever. i was a genius and thought it would be funny if i crossed through and waved to my family. so you know i'm waving to my family and without any doubt my family began to freak out. afaik they shit themselves. i could tell they were freaking out. so i ran through the building, past the police border control people, whatever. i was a 8-9 year old getting chased by police. they were nice about it, but everyone was staring.",2

well, i so happened to be going home from college after classes on friday and almost immediately it started to sprinkle a bit, but it was all good. but then, out of nowhere it's like the heavens decided to give my town all it had and let loose a downpour like i haven't seen in a long time. in fact, as an 18 year old and getting my license at 17, i'm a pretty new driver. 

i was driving home and could only see the person's lights in front of me. luckily i knew where i was going, and turned into my neighborhood. but i forget one thing about my neighborhood. the entrance, it floods like crazy. so, with my old car (27 years old?) i drive through this puddle which i could not see. i felt like i was in a boat for an instance but got luckily made it home o.k.

fast forward a day later and i'm driving to work and my car starts to rev back and forth, so i go to pull over and it completely stalls out. well, called my parents and my dad got it home fine. let it dry out, he said.

it didn't. finally i'm driving back to campus and stall out in an intersection, gas smell and i can't move the fucking wheel. parents once again came to save the day and somehow my dad got it back to campus by putting it in neutral. he said it stalled out on him about 50 times.

352_2_3,"so this one actually happened 2 years ago, i only remembered it today as i'm on holiday in the same place.

a brit abroad in new hampshire, i was spending the day with my family on a beautiful, if slightly crowded, lakeside beach. it being a swelteringly hot day, i decided to go for a swim. now i'm quite a strong swimmer and decided to challenge myself to go all the way along the beach without stopping. naturally, i had my head down and was pretty determined, although about 2/3 of the way round, i was starting to get pretty tired, to the point where it was no longer fun. out of the corner of my eye, i'd noticed a few people on the shore giving me funny looks as well, so i figured my technique had gone to hell and i was flapping about like a dying fish.

with all this in mind, when i came up for air to find a few more people standing near me (importantly, i was between them and the shore), i gave up, fancying a rest and a bit of a chat.

""lovely day for it, isn't it!""
""yeah, guess it is...""
""you local?""
""yup...""
""wow, must be amazing to live near a place like this!""
""...""

i was baffled! i'd always thought americans were supposed to be friendly, but two of the three decent looking gentlemen were staring straight past me, while the third glowered at me with an intensity normally reserved for tarantino films. all in all, it put me off my swim completely, so i turned for shore...

...and bumped straight into the pastor, lifting the young lad who was being baptised out of the water. down the three of us went together, in an almighty (pardon the pun) splash of limbs. i cannot underestimate the size of the crowd i had somehow failed to notice watching. although the pastor found it funny, the kid seemed utterly horrified (if you fall over during your baptism, do you go to hell?) and his parents weren't much happier.

i learnt a lot about myself, religion and most importantly the sense of humour in rural new england that day.",1

a couple months ago, i got drunk and thought downloading tinder would be fun (i was absolutely right, but that's not the point). i started talking to and hanging out with this guy to the point where we were talking every day and hanging out every weekend for a month or so. for the first time since my ex, i started to let myself actually like someone...and then i got ghosted. womp. 

it seems stupid, but i took the whole thing pretty tough and have been trying to find things to keep myself busy for the last month. i came into work today after taking a long weekend and realized that i hadn't finished up this proposal for a huge potential client. i had to tell my boss about everything and i stupidly mentioned the guy, which ended in her giving me a 45 minute pep talk about how i'm worth it and deserve better blah blah blah while my other boss sat awkwardly across the desk silently wishing someone would put a bullet in his brain. i eventually started feeling so bummed and embarrassed that i felt physically ill. then i puked all over my boss's office.",1

bad idea.

i go up behind her, and i kind of poke her shoulders and go ""rah"".

237_2_2,"so, this happened about 8 years ago during my first shift working at mcdonald's (this was my first job as well). had to go into the cool room to get some frozen nuggets. had just watched dumb and dumber the night before and the frozen pole which was attached to the rack caught my attention. i remember watching the scene when harry gets his tongue on the frozen pole and thinking to myself ""that can't happen, your tongue would just come off"". anyway - put down the nuggets, made sure my tongue was really wet and ready to go and stuck it right on the pole. boy did it stick. after about 30 seconds of genuine panic and soft attempts to yank it off i whipped my head back and ripped my tongue free from the pole. blood everywhere and a little bit of my tongue attached on the pole i bolted out of the cool room, only to have my manager ask what the hell happened. unable to talk properly, i told her i slipped in the cool room and bit my tongue on the way down. she instantly sat me down, called my parents and i went home. next shift i came in and the big boss pulled me aside, paid for my lunch, asked me a series of questions and made sure that i was still happy working and that i wasn't angry at the store in any way. they also cleaned out the whole storage room and did a major clean up of the whole mcdonalds store which caused the store to close for a day. since the incident the boss and managers were always extremely nice to me (i now know it's because they were ensuring i didn't turn around a file a law suit against them for providing an unsafe work environment or something like that).",2

184_2_2,"so today we decided to fix up the paint job on a couple of walls on our hallway. no big deal, right? we certainly thought so.

i got the paint, a roller, cleared everything out of the way and got to work. 5 minutes into the job i notice something funny. the paint seems to be peeling off of the wall and on to the roller. i start peeling the coat of paint off of the wall but more and more starts coming off.

as it turns out, there were too many coats of paint on the wall and the one i added made an older layer peel off.

so now here i am, peeling the paint off of the wall with my hand, hoping it will stop peeling off somewhere so i can get on with the paint job. nope! 2 hours and a lot of frustration later i ended up peeling off all of the paint i had put on, as well as parts of the underlying layer.

in the end i just gave up. instead of 30 minutes of touching up the paint job i'll end up pulling down all the wallpaper and starting from scratch. it'll probably end up costing hundreds of euros too.

338_2_3,"it’s my birthday today. happy birthday to me!
my day started well, favorite breakfast, lunch at the street corner on my work, and dinner with friends and family. now as i lay in my bed, my phone beeps for an alarm for my birthday with a letter attachment to it. i wrote myself a letter last year of the things i should do, adventures i should take, lessons i need to learn etc. as i go through the letter i can’t help but notice that i almost accomplished all of those things on the letter.  except for my biggest fu.

i told myself to stop dating different girl every month and just focus on one. and i did. i met her, and with her i am me, no holding back, no lies, not pretending, i am just me. last year was an amazing year because i have her. then i fu. i broke up with her because i got cold feet and i thought we were going too fast and we are going serious too soon. 

now that it is my birthday, i never felt alone. yes, i have my family but i have an estranged relationship with all of them. i have my friends who i met through games but i they never understand the real me. i had her, nothing else matter except her but i lost her because my 25 year old me broke up with her one sunny wednesday thinking it is the right thing to do. of course the player in me, ignore all her calls, and texts, and never answer the door to even just talk. 

if i could go back to fall of last year, i would kick myself in the balls, or i would even touch habanero peppers then remove my contacts and wank without even washing my hands to learn my lesson. 

i never felt so alone, so on my birthday, i hope you guys learn from my lesson. it’s ok to be afraid, to get scared, to feel overwhelmed, because of the end of the day, you have that someone and the feeling being loved is the greatest feeling of all.

70_2_1,"so i will be honest, this happened a few years ago while i was in my english class in college. my professor was a nice enough person, but she was highly liberal with her thoughts. she often tried to get the class discussing/argue different events based on her opinions. my personal favorite was the time she brought up rihanna straddling a pink cannon was a way of empowering women. i had a field day with that one.

anyway so she ends up assigning us an extra paper that was not on the syllabus. i am annoyed because i already have a ton of work for my computer classes, next thing i need is a 7 page persuasive paper to write. so i am annoyed and decide to write on something most people disagree with. polygamy. yes polygamy, not to be confused with polyandry or polyamorous relationships. i wanted to only discuss the single side that men should be able to marry as many women as they choose.

so i already know i am gonna annoy her with my paper. i researched and did a lot of work on it. i needed a quote though. so i decided to look for the most outlandish person i could think of...hitler. by gods i found it! i found a quote from hitler saying approves german soldiers to take as many women as they like.

so i am trolling hard with this paper, i know i am gonna annoy some people just from how one sided this paper is. well i get into class that day. only to find out instead of her doing all the work...the paper will be peer review. my paper got a lot of hate...but i still got a b+. it wasn't until 3 days later i remembered she was jewish too.",4

108_2_1,"so last night/this morning i fucked up big style and almost lost two of my close friends and likely pissed off others. 
how one bad decision leads to another. i've been ill for a while, haven't been sleeping or eating properly either but decide to drink.  want to drink cocktails , thought given recent drinking times i'd be fine and controlled.
nope, i ended up a wasted state.
have been in love with my close friend for years (who i'll just call 'a'),  but i am in a relationship with his best friend (have been for years). this is an open secret however and it is also known that a has feelings for another close friend  of mine ('b'). i also know a used to have feelings for me. of recent, a had been a total dick to me repeatedly so i was already feeling wound up. my frustrations were with him being a shity friend but obviously given the situation it is hard not to and can be justified to jump to the conclusion that his shittiness is due to our past.
so this cocktail of bad decisions is then tested by seeing a give b lots of special treatment and fawning. b has no interest in a and i feel like a is being disrespectful to me by his actions. other close friends bring up with me frequently how a's actions to b are weird and obvious as well as a's actions to me are obvious. should point out that a being so overt is really unusal and he's not had a girlfriend in all the time i've known him or any romantic entanglements besides that i've mentioned.  
so, something in me has snapped and what do i do in my drunken tequila induced state and do not remember? i want to make a hurt how i hurt, so i start slinging really vicious insults about b to a. i said some awful things , words i'd never use otherwise and not even used to describe people i don't actually even like.
a has thrown a drink on me, i attempted to physically retaliate, b has overheard all the horrible shit i have said. 
so i stormed out and got a taxi home and proceeded to cry and get in contact with people at 7am to cry some more because i am sick of feeling anything for a.",3
226_2_2,"yesterday morning i was multitasking,

i put milk on the stove and then went 
to the bathroom to shave, which in itself is not a good idea.

while sitting on the toilet i was listening to my ipod classic and began
to put on a landing strip. approching take off i cut myself and propelled my ipod into the bowl, panicking i get up knocking my head against the mirror door.

so by this time i'm lying on the floor bleeding at multiple spots and confused as hell. after realizing what has happend i plan on getting my ipod and turning it off. easier said than done, grabbing it out of the bowl i notice that i got no idea how to accomplish this trivial seeming task.

sprinting to my laptop and getting blood everywhere i hold play on my ipod. nothing happens. i figure out that i have to hold play and center, wait for it to boot up fully(which is an eternity for apple products) and then turn it off. after 2 minutes or so i finally succeed. 

remember the milk from the beginning? well me neither. but my alarm did and comes screaming at me while i'm disinfecting nearly giving me a heart attack.

you'll probably like to know if the ipod is working.
it does, but it displays a firewire not plugged in message from time to time (which makes sense i guess, since firewire isn't plugged in)

50_2_1,"last night i drank almost an entire bottle of good bourbon. at some point while i was trying to fill the void in my soul, which possibly exists due to previous relationships i've decimated single handedly or maybe my father dying, or the impending thought that my mother,  the only parent i have left, is a smoker and has been for a long time. she won't always be around. i'm terrified of being 23 and parentless especially because i have two younger brothers who i would have to figure out how to take care of should my mom pass anytime in the near future. so yeah i'm drinking with some buddies and one of them mentions he has a spare ticket to the 10am imax star wars showing. so i agree to go, neglecting to realize just how horrible i'm going to feel tomorrow. 

so i wake up this morning and i'm miserably hungover. it was the kind of hangover where you feel like you have a side stitch, like you just ran a couple miles, but we both know damn well the only thing you're running from is your own past and insecurities. can that cause a side stitch? 

we get to the theater after a quick breakfast and we sit down. this was my first time in imax and it was visually and audibly stunning. then it can became visually and audibly overwhelming. then it became visually and audibly nauseating. then i power spewed pork roll and eggs all over the two rows in front. it really just came out with no warning, like spit up. it's a good movie though.

in the pool, the only toilets are in the change rooms, and when i need to go i usually go into the family changing room because it is much closer, cleaner and usually there is nobody in it. so my break came up and i went to go do my business when i get to the door i notice it is wide open, i don't hear any noises, and everybody who had come for a swim should have been gone already, so i don't bother yelling into the room just to check. this is where i fucked up. i stroll on in and as i turn the corner after the door, there facing right at me is a 100% buck naked old woman with no nearby towel. she saw me and tried to hide behind one of the benches yelling, as i immediately got out of there as fast as humanly possible saying that i was sorry. the image shall be forever ingrained in my brain. the silhouette of her saggy boobs...  the thought brings back trauma.  who the  fuck leaves a door open and unlocked in a community center.... by definition there are going to be people around. i will never enter a public room again without loudly announcing myself ever again.",3

about 30 minutes later, i started to hear screaming and crying from my room, so i rushed back. my girlfriend was very angry and accused me of always choosing maths over her and gave me an ultimatum of either i start paying more attention to her or she leaves me. i told her that i can't help being enthusiastic about my subject and she will have to deal with it - she then put her clothes on, walked out and slammed the door. i decided to sleep on it before deciding what to do, but when i tried to contact her via facebook in the morning i discovered her relationship status was ""single"" and that she had de-friended me.",3

got to mine and she was stuck on her phone yet again, sat far away from me when usually she'd be sat right next to me, snuggled up. asked her again what was wrong but no answer. then she left to head back to hers.

skip forward to tonight, rang her after a few days to sort my head out as to why things were to weird that night. i told her that i enjoyed being with her but it was unfair to treat me like that, being ignored and given the cold shoulder, even after trying to help. i did say that i really did like her afterwards and she said is that all? the call ended shortly after.

you see, not only did they have typical room mate habits (not helping, messy, etc...) but they also have these two children. 

these kids are dicks. seriously i do understand it's because of the way they were raised but these kids are little satans. i can't help but hate them. they really are the worst kids i've met.

they came over unannounced to my moms today. it was just supposed to be me coming over with my son...so when they walked in, i had fire in my eyes. i saw visions of all my sons new toys being ripped out of his hands and broken like last year. they really have no control over their kids. 

quickly i grabbed all our things and hid them before they had even a chance. i was not about to have my christmas ruined. luckily my son is not even 2 so he was totally fine with having just one toy. 

so...all the kids play. my sister is their age so they fought over toys for a while. lots of crying and my sister trying to explain nicely why she doesn't want to share.

one day, i discovered that the gas taps shared the same connector as the water taps, so i plugged in a bunsen burner and started a whole class water fight. poor ms k tried to stop it but couldn't, until she lost her shit and stormed out of the classroom. i went home that afternoon and gleefully described the chaos in the classroom to my mother, who then went quiet and asked in a threatening voice ""you mean linda k? you dared to muck up in front of her?""

i had no idea who this old fart was, and what my mother's relationship was with her. i only found out when she dragged me over to her house to apologise. turns out she was a close family friend and was there at the hospital when i was born. she guilted me by showing me my baby photos. needless to say i pulled my socks up and didn't cause any more trouble in the few remaining weeks of the school year.",4

i couldn't get to sleep easily, so i decided to lay awake until my sister woke up to go to work (she has to leave for work at 3am) and take her comfy double bed with a plethora of pillows.

once she finished getting ready for work and left, i immediately got up and into her room. i noticed she left her sheets and pillows in a mess, so i start rearranging them. the first thing i do is move her main pillow from where it lay, and my hands catch an object underneath.

i placed the pillow aside and look in horror as i've just picked up my sister's vibrator. large, pink vibrator.
immediately i drop it, turn the light off, back out of the room, and washed my hands for i don't know how long. there wasn't enough soap in the world.

my efforts to have a ridiculously comfy sleep turned into one of my hardest sleeps ever.

now let me get this cleared up, i don't have a bias towards razer or anything like that.

okay now lets start the story, so if you guys play on pc you will know mechanical keyboards are awesome, but alas i spent all my money on my pc first, because well as a teen im kinda broke right now.

so my friend he has an old razer blackwidow classic edition and im like sure 40$ ill take it, now this is a in canada and b they are normally 100$ for a decent mechanical keyboard so to me this was a no brainer.

so i rush home excited about this and everything and then the manual says download razer synapse so i do. says i need an update and that so i download the update its at 0% and i wait a bit and i step out of my room, and get a drink of water.

at that same time one of my family members and by that i mean my dog decides to pull the cord on the surge protector power bar thing now in my room i have my desk and pc and on the other to my left is a surge protector power bar thing, and there are some loose easily pullible wires.

so of course the wire was sticking enough so that she decides to walk into it and pulls the wire out.

so here i am typing on my shitty 5$ dell keyboard instead of this mechanical keyboard on my desk that is bricked. fuck me.

 

edit: seemed to have found the problem, but not the fix windows doesnt know what it is doesnt know its a keyboard, i messaged razer and now we wait...",1

401_2_3,"so this just happened and i am dreading coming home tonight. 

my boyfriend sent me a 5 minute voicemail saying how awesome i was and just generally goofing off. i laughed my head off and i wanted to save that voicemail so i could send it back to him. so i saved the voicemail and then tried to forward it to my bf. i wasn't paying attention to what i was doing and instead of forwarding the message to my bf, i sent it to my dad. 

this is extra awkward since i am also a guy and am not out to my family.

243_2_2,"to start the story i have to go back about a week. i got new box springs for my hand-me-down king size bed from the nebraska furniture warehouse. they tied the two twin box springs down after we waited an hour with rope and so we set on home. to make it fit in my room better i decided to clean, paint, and get rid of a giant desk. i took the desk apart and threw it in the back of the pickup. got the bed, slept great whatever. today about four days later i decided to go to the weight room. i grabbed the keys and set to the truck. when i was younger we weren't on top of the whole driving thing so here i am 17 and only have a permit deciding to drive. i get to the weight room and as soon as i pull into the parking spot i back up to readjust myself and hear a clank sound. i'm thinking the wood fell out; i go out to put it back in. there isn't any wood on the ground instead the exhaust pipe fell. i get one of my friends in the weight room and he says just make sure it isn't hitting the tire.  i call two other friends just to see if they could help. we look under there and the clamp that holds the tailpipe is twisted. so shit it's not fixable by me. my friend calls his more truck savvy dad but he is at work. so using rope that's still in the truck we kinda rig it up. i get it home and like a pussy i go to my friends house not worrying about it. at dq my brother gets a call. we go home, i lie then confess because i was fucked. i get grounded for 2 weeks and lose all trust. my brother is absolved of it because he did nothing but lie for me. apparently there was rope in the drive way and some wedged under the tool box in the bed. what happened was the rope from the week before got twisted the clamp some how and popped the exhaust pipe out. it's part bad luck part me just being a retard and not walking.",3

412_2_3,"this has built up over the past several days, so at this point i'm well aware of how wrong i was in thinking my family wouldn't be greatly disappointed in not being there for the ""official"" event.

quick background- 
  my girlfriend and i met when i first moved to a new area several years ago (closer to 10 than five).  not long after meeting, i was laid off from my job.  by the time we knew we would get married we felt like we needed to be more financially stable before taking the next step.  
  we have now purchased a home together in a new area, and are getting things moving in the right direction.  last weekend while discussing future plans, marriage came up.  i asked her if she ""had any plans next weekend"", and she said ""no"".  it was at that moment i asked her how she would feel about having her anniversary on 12-13-15.  
surprise factor = 100
romance factor = zero

here is where the tifu happens:
because of the short notice, the two of us looked at it as being a legal procedure.  none of our parents live in our state, and we're not religious.  our plan is to meet a few of my relatives and friends who live nearby, and we would get married in a park.  then, next year we would have a planned ceremony and reception for all of our friends and family.
problem is, we are the only two who looked at it this way.  a number of people feel left out, and my mom was very hurt.  had i realized how important this would have been for everyone else, i wouldn't have waited until the last minute to confirm the date.

 

edit*left the last t off of thought.

edit 2- we would have been happy if all those interested in attending could make it but my procrastination didn't leave much time to make plans for the specific day we wanted to marry.

those who didn't make it still sent love, wished us well, and were fully supportive.  they just would have liked to be there too.",2

264_2_2,"a month or so ago i scored the opportunity of a lifetime by being accepted as a candidate for a 2016 paid summer internship at a large global bank.  i'm an excellent student majoring in business and i'm graduating in june.  so this internship could turn into a full time job come the fall.

after 3 rounds of interviews i was still standing.  i had one last meeting to get through - and it was going great until the last question.

""talk about a situation where teamwork and collaboration really made a difference.""

i blurted out the most recent situation that came to mind without stopping to consider things more broadly.

""i'm captain of my soccer team.  and practice this past friday was attended by quite a few girls.   everyone's first instincts are to show off and be as impressive as possible.  but i decided to hold back and give my team mates a chance to shine.""

my interviewer's demeanor visibly changed, and i realized immediately that she wasn't at all keen on my answer.   i shifted gears and provided another example about a group project at school.

it failed to rekindle her interest though.  she said nothing about either of my examples.   she asked no follow up questions at all.  

""do you have any questions for me?"" she asked tersely.  when all was said and done, the interview ended 10 minutes early.  

it's been a week and a half, and i haven't heard a word.  in the past they've always gotten back to me  a day or two later.

well drunk me thought it would be fun to text my ex, who until now had a pretty harmless breakup and we were still friends.

so i proceed to drunk text her random chatty shit when out of nowhere i suggest she come over and we can have fun.

she immediately assumes sex and gets all upset, granted i totally kind of wanted some, but now she has like told a few people what kind of person i am

like fuck me right?

406_2_3,"i work for a small clothing company made up of a boss and employees that are major hipsters, so i never would have expected this.

i just moved into a new place and everything is finally sound, except my walls are a bit boring. so i decided to hit up amazon for some posters and such to plaster all over the place. i eventually end up looking at flags. canadian, old school american ones, etc. anything that will look cool and might get me praise from my family members. one thing led to another and my curiosity got the best of me. ""ah, amazon has everything!, but would they actually have an isis flag?!"" well, of course i would not dare buy one or hang one up, that's in really poor taste in my opinion but of course i just haaaad to search for it. 

turns out, they don't carry them! i guess that's a relief, i don't think people should be buying those, so whatever, right? i go on with my day! the next thing i know i see two cop cars pull up and my manager walk outside and talk to them. what could be going on? this is a small office where our manager and employees do minimal work and bullshit over beers most of the time. i surely would have heard something popping off in the office, right?

turns out my boss can see everything that is done on our work computers. he uses one of those programs that teachers in schools use to monitor their students progress and make sure they're not slacking off. he saw me make multiple search queries on isis flags and decided to call the police.

after being escorted out of the building and taken around the corner for a talk with the officers, after much convincing and a sheer stroke of luck, i was allowed to go home.

107_2_1,"on a 20-hour roadtrip car-ride split into two days, my boyfriend's family and i stopped at a moe's. for the next 48 hours, i had awful indigestion, but was way too embarrassed to say anything. the day after my moe's feast, my boyfriend kept saying he smelled methane. we couldn't figure it out. 


when we were finally half an hour from home, i burped and he immediately said he smelled methane. so then i launched into a full-on experiment, but wasn't going to tell him about my silent torture. every time i silently burped, he smelled methane. 


we got to the house, aaaand it smelled like natural gas. someone had left the gas-stovetop on for our entire 12-day vacation. we called the fire dept., stood in the rain for thirty minutes while they aired out the house, and woke up all of our neighbors. 


my boyfriend turned to me, quite shaken up, and had a divine revelation. ""i've smelled methane all day! what if it was like, a weird precursor to this? maybe it was some kind of sign from god or something!""


i did eventually tell him that it was me, burping up my moe's, and that god had not sent him any sneak-peeks of natural gasses. our relationship is still going strong.",3

268_2_2,"obligatory ""this did not happen today.""

 

about 15 years ago i worked in a microbiology lab in the media kitchen area.  basically my job consisted of washing dishes but i also sometimes was put to work making reagents, filling petri dishes, etc.  

on this particular day i was set to task to make a blue dyeing reagent meant to be used in a production run for a stool sample testing kit.  since it was for production and not just lab use it was very important that it be made correctly. this was stressed to me repeatedly. ""this needs to be by the book!""

so instead of just processing off the order sheet i pulled our department reagent book to get the official formulation and created the item from that.  now is where the fu comes into play.  whoever it is that put in the order had at some point changed the formulation and we had an old copy of it in our book.  the book showed the weights listed in mg or milligrams, but the order had it in mcg or micrograms.  so i proceed and process the order by the book!

reagent goes off to production and is ran and made into testing kits.  the next day quality assurances pulls a few kits to test and they fail.  horribly.  why? well there was 1000x more blue dye than the order called for.  

i get pulled into a meeting where i get dressed down about this fu that's costing the company thousands to fix.  i am beside myself with guilt and apologize.  when i notice the discrepancy i bring it up to the person who ordered the reagent, she takes it to my boss's direct supervisor who then dresses down my boss for the fu of not updating the formulation book for 3 years.  i then get treated like a moron for the remaining 6 months i worked there.",3
357_2_3,"a few hours ago i went to have lunch with my mother. we debated about what to eat, and i thought some hot dogs. she said no, since she turned vegetarian recently, along with my sister.

anywho, we went over to a restaurant we've gone to before without trouble, until now. we ate chow mein, brown rice with shrimp, and shark fin soup with some hot black tea. it was delicious. 

after we finished eating, she paid, and i ate some vanilla ice cream and my fortune cookie. we left and went to the supermarket next to the restaurant because we needed toilet paper.

while shopping, i get really bad stomach aches, but ignore them to the point that my mom takes notice and asks if i should use the bathroom. i ran without answering.

while inside, i did my duty and was going to get paper, when i just felt the cardboard carcass of what should've been white, soft toilet paper. i sit there for a bit contemplating what to do, since i don't have internet to call her. until i get an idea.

on release date, i went to see jason bourne with my family. it was nice, and i saved the tickets. in my haste, i used those very tickets to wipe myself, along with some writing paper i had in my wallet. it wasn't pleasant, but i did what i had to. 

once i was out, my mother asked me if i was better, i said yes, i was lying. we went home and she doesn't know this happened. also, i'm typing this from the bathroom in my house. i went, again.",1
