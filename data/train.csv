"a good friends sister moved to our city from another province and he asked me and another mutual buddy to help move her in to her place. we agreed and go down to her place, meet her for the first time, and proceed to move her in. she has an instant attraction to other buddy and they start a relationship. her brother is ok with it because buddy is a good kid and responsible. anyway one thing leads to another and he gets her pregnant and i'm told of the dilemma because they don't know what to do. i tell them it's either they keep it or terminate the pregnancy. they decided abortion is best and book an appointment to get it done. buddy who got her pregnant tells her after the abortion they are done, do she is heartbroken and doesn't know what to do. we, as a group, go out to the bar and she is mangled drunk, and starts texting me suggestive things. i'm half cut at this point and my dick takes over and one thing leads to another and i end up fucking her. i'm scared what will happen if her bro finds out because we are such good friends :(",4,evaluation,relationship,documents

"i’ll preface this with a bit of backstory: i’m a guy, i work full time in the city but live at home in the suburbs with my very catholic parents. a couple of years ago my mum suffered a bout of viral encephalitis so her brain isn't really 100% but she’s still my mum. sometimes she makes mistakes but we still let her do the day to day things she used to do, like iron clothes and make dinner. mum stuff.

anyway, this morning i’m drying my hair getting ready for work and mum opens my bedroom door.

“dokkanosaur, do you want this hair brush? i don’t really use it.” i’m still sort of waking up so this caught me off guard. “uh, i guess? i’ll just put it in the bathroom if you don’t want it”, i reply. i thought that was a sweet gesture so i said thanks anyway explained where i’d leave it, just in case mum decided she wanted it back. 

“i’ll just put it here in this drawer, okay?” i suggest. “you can put it anywhere you want to, son.” i’m not really sure what she means by that. “sure, okay. love you mum.” i attempt to hug my mother but she resists a bit.

“is everything okay? don’t you want to hug your son?” i usually play this game with her, she’s a bit of a sulk so i like to brighten things up with a hug every now and then. she turns to me... “i’m just a bit concerned about you, that’s all”. not the response i expected...

“why? what’s wrong?”... 
she responds with “i don’t really have the words now.”

ouch. okay now i’m really confused. i’m running late for work so i can’t really press this issue any further. skip ahead 15 minutes and i’m on the bus when i get a text from my brother:

“hahahahaha mum thinks your gay”

oh shit, that’s awkward. what now, reddit?

nb: i am straight and very comfortable with my sexuality. i’ve spent most of my adult life in a relationship with one girl or another (23/m/aus, recently single, feel free to hit me up, ladies). if i was gay, i’d have no shame in it and would have plenty of support from friends and family.",1,evaluation,family,tldr
"i am a dumbfuck. probably the biggest one in a 300 mile radius. i recently took my gf's pc to my place to upgrade it to this years tech and she did remind me that there's nothing for me to see there. 

as an idiot would, i did go through the whole pc and found tons of photos of her and her ex posing, kissing and many other such photos. i felt terrible seeing those because firstly, i was a virgin before i met her and she was in a long ass relationship with her ex. coupled with my self esteem issues, this dude actually looked much better than me and makes me wonder if i can ever match up to his standard. 

coming to the incident, i was mad at her for some useless reason which i don't even remember now and i ended up sending her this pic saying, "" here. i hope you feel happy about me seeing this"". the second i sent it i realized my fuck up and i feel horrible about it. 

rationalization: how does one react to finding such pictures. i personally feel like shit every time i picture it. am i just a piece of shit person for feeling like this? 

justification: i wanted her to feel bad because she made me feel bad. that's the shittiest justification for my actions.",4,evaluation,relationship,documents

i had never made out with anyone until my sophomore year of high school, and i was nervous so i let my boyfriend lead the way. first f up there. 
he thought the whole ""biting the lip"" thing was sexy, which maybe it could have been if a) i weren't still covered in a thick layer of baby fat and b) he hadn't bitten my lip like a piece of meat. the bite hurt but okay, he's trying, right? he gave up on the biting and went on to just legitimately sucking my face off. you should not have to clean dog-like drool from your entire face, but i did. 
after this 15 minutes or so of pure, unprecedented torture, my dad came to pick me up. my lips felt really swollen, but i thought it would just go down on the way home, wrong.

"the tire pressure monitor went off while me and peaches (my corgi) where going to the store. stopped at the nearest parking lot, got out walked around to the passenger side, check the tire. its good. must be the sensor. come back to the driver door. its locked. with my phone, wallet, and my precious baby corgi all inside. don't panic. should i break the window? which one should i break? its a few miles hike home to get my spare key, and hopefully get a ride. i weight my options. truck is running, with a/c going, peaches will be ok assuming someone doesn't break the window and steal my truck and her. its not the greatest neighborhood around here. tie my shoes tighter, take my shirt off, and start the 3.3 mile run home in 104 degree heat. that was the last 60 minutes of my life.

during my 5k run home, i had plenty of time to re-think how this could have happened. i troubleshoot technical issues all day at work, so i put those skills to use. i came to the conclusion that the only way this was possible is that my corgi peaches, must have hit the manual lock with her paw.

"tifu, reddit, boy did i fuck up.


i have an assignment that was due 9 days ago, but i'm useless so i just handed it in last night.


i'd been awake and working on it for 19 hours. all that was left to do was make a video of what i'd created with commentary on theme etc.


it's about 4am, and i'm recording said commentary, i must've re-done it about 30 times at this point, and stress levels were at an all time high. 


i would note that a lot of people had their last exam yesterday, and as such decided to go out and celebrate... students will be students, right?


i could hear my flat-mates being rowdy, and in my sleep deprived state, i lost my temper and shouted obscenities at them. they shut up... eventually.


ahhhh, the home stretch. i did one more take and nailed it. brilliant. let's get this bad boy submitted so i can get some well-earned sleep!


i woke up today, and decided to relive the hell that's kept me from sleep for so long. within 10 seconds i knew that i'd fucked up, because the wording was different to the commentary i wanted to use... 4 minutes in it hit me like a ton of bricks... 


*""i decided to use a darker theme to make this floo- will you lot shut the fuck up, jesus christ!""*

"i'm not sure if there's a sub to submit other people's fuck-ups, but i just witnessed this happen to a friend of mine(we'll call him moe). the next paragraph is from his pov just for context:

*so fuckupsnitch and another friend(we'll call him bart) wanted to meet me at the mall this evening. i just happened to be nearby and decide to wait at starbucks making it a great rendezvous point. as i devour a panini, i stare at a blank space at the wall and get lost in a sea of nothingness. i dare not blink and my eyes are fixated at this point. i see and hear nothing. it's just the panini and me. all of a sudden, i'm violently shook by a man.*

back to me(not moe). 

at this point, i walk up to the starbucks with my mate and see our panini devouring buddy sat at a table, staring directly across with a rather angry saudi man standing next to him. we notice his gaze is fixed. his body and head may be moving, but his eyes haven't. as he snaps out of his trance, the saudi man takes off one of his slippers and starts beating our friend with it. bart and i burst out laughing. moe's always getting himself into trouble. we wonder what he's done. we walk up to the table to try to calm down a livid saudi man, and then we hear moe say ""but sir, really, i don't even like boobs. i would never! i'm not that kind of guy"" this went on back and forth, moe ended up explaining to the rest of the patrons at the starbucks that he really wasn't a pervert and we were asked to leave otherwise they would inform the authorities.

turns out, moe was so lost in his own world, he failed to notice the saudi family sit at the table right there and he failed to notice how uncomfortable he was making the woman by staring right at her chest and failed to notice the saudi man repeatedly warning him to stop.",1,part3,relationship,tldr

"as is the usual on a friday, i leave work and go home for some ""lunch""(we refer to it as fuck me fridays at home).  things we're going well, i walked in the door and said hello to the dogs, then walked over to say hi to my wife.  we walked into the kitchen to set down the food i brought home(i love you jimmy johns!), and well... things escalated quickly. 

we didn't even make it all the way into the kitchen before clothes started coming off.  she had taken my shirt off and pulled my pants down, i didn't even bother taking my shoes off because this was happening then and there--no time for disrobing completely.  at first she was sitting up on the counter bracing herself with her feet against the fridge while i did my best to fuck her right off the counter.  things were going great, except i had yet to notice one of the dogs was standing in the kitchen barking every now and then at us (she was my wife's dog years before we met, and she is very protective).  things escalated and i picked her up and put her on the kitchen table... admit it, so far my lunch is going great, right?

well, that's when shit took a turn downhill.  as many of you know.. a good ol' fucking can sometimes sound pretty damn violent--especially when she is screaming.  i didn't think about it because hey, this is normal for us.. the dog thought differently and apparently assumed i was beating mommy.  after a few moments, the dog began barking more, then more, and then... the growl.  i heard it while it happened, but didn't realize it until it was too late.

all of the sudden i could not just hear the growl, but feel it... then, in a moment my ass wont forget for a while, i feel it.  she barks once, and then bites me full on, right on my left ass cheek.  

i instantly go limp dick, and the lunch fuck is ruined.  we got a good laugh out of it, but didn't get to finish as i had to go back to work by the time we cooled off from the incident.

"so, this is all in all was a build up for over a few weeks.
my best friend is very into cosplay (dressing up like characters for fun and all) and i'm very good friends with her boyfriend as well as his roomate. he and i have been friends since we were 12 (we're now 21). anyway, they both got into a major fight, the biggest fight of their young relationship so far. she felt as if they may break up over it, so she texts me and asked if i could grab a spiked leather collar and leather bracelets, since i was home at the time. so i do and i put them in my car saying that i'll give them back to her. no big deal. well, their fight cools off and we forget about her spiked leather accessories that are tucked neatly away in the center console of my car and go about our busy university lives. and this is where my fuck up begins to build up.
fast forward to this past saturday.
i notice that my check engine light comes on. nothing seems off about my car, so i call my dad the following afternoon and he offers to check it out himself and if he couldn't find anything wrong, we'll take it somewhere to get it looked at. 
in my hurry to get over to my dad's house this morning, i didn't clean out my car as i had originally hoped to do, so i just get over there asap. he couldn't find anything wrong with it up front. so we begin cleaning it out.
lo and behold, the first thing my dad decided to clean out was my center console. and sure enough. bam. there was my friend's accessories. my poor 61 year old father gasps and demands to know if there are any other bdsm toys i'm hiding in my car. of course no amount of explination is enough to get him to believe me. so now my dad believes i'm into some seriously kinky shit.",3,evaluation,relationship,documents
"well it was actually earlier this month and it was maybe a bit more my mum fucking up. 

so my family and me had gone on holiday to germany to visit my uncle's new house which he has just finished renovating. 

one day he was out at work and we were in his house with his girlfriend. suddenly my mum screams and we all go over and there's this big green bug. i kind of walk away once i realise it's not anything major and leave everyone else to it. 

i then see my uncle's girlfriend go into a drawer in the kitchen and bring out a bottle of pepper spray (it's probably good to mention that we live in the uk and pepper spray is illegal there so we hadn't ever seen it before). she then goes upstairs and hands the bottle to my mum. 

i follow and start to think this might not be a great idea. anyway, the bug was on the stairs and we were all at the bottom except for my mum who was closer to the top near the bug. she then points it at the bug and sprays. 

as it turns out, pepper spray is red and all the walls were white. when she sprayed it, it was like paint being sprayed on the wall. it was red and went quite a bit on the wall.

we then all realised we had made a big mistake. as we start talking about what to do we all start to cough violently. pepper spray can also travel through the air. we all run down to the ground floor and think we have escaped the air. for a while, it held true. approximately 30 seconds. we then had to open all the doors and windows and we were coughing and our eyes were starting to stream. 

it eventually cleared out of the air and the stain mostly washed away but not completely. we never told my uncle but it's a good thing his eyesight isn't great so he'll probably never see it.",1,part3,relationship,tldr

my grandparents have a ""big"" farm next to their house, so we decide to play hide and seek. a couple rounds go by, nothing unusual happening, then suddenly i have the brilliant idea of running through the corn field and hide in the other side, no way i would lose. that's where the fu happens.
i'm running without looking at the floor and suddenly my foot gets stuck. i fell on a goddamn animal trap. (something like this http://www.thefurtrapper.com/images/lane%20trap.jpg)
i tried to release myself from the clutches of the devil for what felt like an hour, until finally the other kids start to get worried and call our parents, who just found me sitting on the floor with a trap on my foot.

in my neighborhood everyone is pretty close, and my family is especially close with my next door neighbor. we're always watching their house when they are out on vacation and vice versa. anyways, my neighbor always keeps a key hidden in case we need to get into his house for some reason and we all know where it is. you probably know where i'm going worth this, but to those of you who don't, i ended up walking to my neighbors house, letting myself in with the key and going back to sleep in one of their beds upstairs (they were not home at the time thank god). where the extreme fuckup happens is that they have a security system that will call the cops if a code isn't typed within a certain amount of seconds even if the key is being used. my sleepwalking self didn't think to enter the code so about 20 minutes later i woke up to the yelling and a bright flashlight being shined in my face. i had no fucking clue what was going on in ""my bedroom"". 

after being booked in jail and treated like a robber ""high enough to pass out in someone else's bed"" i finally got out today when the neighbors informed the police that they won't be pressing charges. luckily my parents could prove to them that i have this condition, and even more luckily i wasn't shot by the cops or my neighbor if he would have been home.",2,exploration,work,documents

while my dad was on his second tour in afghanistan, my mom decided to take my little sister to the philippines to visit some relatives, leaving my brother and i by ourselves at home.

one late night, after browsing through endless youtube videos, i came across a video that pranked people on chatroulette by appearing as a famous celebrity such as justin bieber or drake. 
i figured out how to do it and made it so i appeared as wiz khalifa smoking on my webcam. after getting numerous hilarious reactions, i decided to call it a night.

i woke up the next morning and my dad ended up calling me through skype. i had forgotten the fact that i still had the video of wiz on my video feed and answered the video call with my dad. the video had no audio and my audio input was turned off so  i couldn't tell my dad it was fake. i tried switching it back during the call but he quickly hung up. i tried calling back but he didn't answer. i was freaking out at this point. 

he ended up calling my older sister at work and letting her know what's going on. he assumed that a random black guy, ""wiz khalifa"" had broken into our house and is smoking weed in our office. 
my older sister called me and asked me what the hell is going on. i explained to her and she told me that my uncle (retired cop) is on his way with a unit from the police station to check up on the house.

now let me get this cleared up, i don't have a bias towards razer or anything like that.

okay now lets start the story, so if you guys play on pc you will know mechanical keyboards are awesome, but alas i spent all my money on my pc first, because well as a teen im kinda broke right now.

so my friend he has an old razer blackwidow classic edition and im like sure 40$ ill take it, now this is a in canada and b they are normally 100$ for a decent mechanical keyboard so to me this was a no brainer.

so i rush home excited about this and everything and then the manual says download razer synapse so i do. says i need an update and that so i download the update its at 0% and i wait a bit and i step out of my room, and get a drink of water.

at that same time one of my family members and by that i mean my dog decides to pull the cord on the surge protector power bar thing now in my room i have my desk and pc and on the other to my left is a surge protector power bar thing, and there are some loose easily pullible wires.

so of course the wire was sticking enough so that she decides to walk into it and pulls the wire out.

so here i am typing on my shitty 5$ dell keyboard instead of this mechanical keyboard on my desk that is bricked. fuck me.

"this happened around 5 years ago when i was 15.

 my family was on vacation in london and at one point we went to a store that had some military stuff, and i wanted to buy a grenade there with the explosive core taken out. basically it was the metal, heavy outer part of a grenade with a hollow inside. of course i had my dad buy it for me and i took it home cause i thought it was too cool. 

when we were sitting in the airport on our layover back from london in germany, the person at the desk called for me to come to the desk on the speaker. they then proceeded to bring me into a room where multiple soldiers were with guns drawn and ready and my checked bag on the ground in the middle. they asked me to go through it and confused and shaky, i went through the bag. i then realized that the grenade was there and that i was in a potentially terrible situation. i explained to them what it was and they to prove it by pulling the pin. while this confused me because this seemed like a terrible decision on their part, yet there were soldiers with guns out around me, i confidently pulled the pin of the grenade, it didn't explode. now every time i fly my checked bag is subject to ""random searches,"" as they tell me.  the best part is that the grenade wasn't caught in london but actually later in germany.",3,part3,relationship,tldr

  so i work nights at costco as a forklift driver part time.  we're usually understaffed and everyone is usually in a rush to get everything done in time (we have some dumb rule about no overtime).  

  i was emptying one of our storage trucks and as i turned a corner to get to where the stack of products should be put, the stack i was carrying (outdoor solar powered lights) started to tip, but not fall over.  as i drove further down the aisle, it felt like there was nothing on my forks.  i looked over and saw the stack slowly tipping over, and finally crash into the cooler where all the meat is kept.  (it's a single deck meat case for clarification)  

  the solar lights bent the frame that the dual paned glass is in and shattered all of the glass.  we had to get rid of all the meat in the meat case due to potentially dangerous glass shards (unable to see with the naked eye) hurting the customers.  

  it was approximately $5000 worth of meat that has to get thrown out and another $2000 to fix the meat case.  thankfully i'm not the one who has to shell out the money to fix all of this, but it kind of sucks to know that i'll be walking by a damaged meat case every day knowing it was i who damaged it.",3,exploration,relationship,tldr

it turns out that the previous owner and so share an account, so they (so) found the book charges and confronted the previous owner about it. everything had been left in tact, including the credit card information (which i had switched over to my information prior to purchase) but otherwise, i hadn't modified the account nor did i think to create my own. (thus, i totally deserved the shit storm that ensued.)

update: things are cool now and i've gotten a few playful texts poking fun at the books from the previous owner. made my own account... and what the fuck was i thinking prior to this? lol!

"here's the story, over the weekend i went out with some friends with the plan of crashing on their couch. in the process of said visit, i had many drinks and became intoxicated (all too typical of a night, believe me i recognize now it's a problem). when headed back to my friend's place to tuck in for the night, i walked in the door and to the right of it immediately when you walk in is a statue of george washington with a detachable head. 

having had a few many drinks i had decided that i was going to put this head on it's body and slap the statue around a bit. eventually that escalated to a point in which in my drunken stupor, thinking it would look cool, i proceeded to take the head outside and smash it on the pavement (a giant asshole and douchebag move on my part).

unbeknownst to me at the time however this statue was the property of my friend's roommate, and it turns out it was one of the few items handed down to him from his dad. i am not sure what it would be valued at in the market, but i know this guy values it highly and i ruined it. i now feel like the world's biggest asshole and tool, but want to try to find some way to make it up to the guy (if that is even possible). 

 

despite any restitution agreement the two of us come to, i would like to replace the head if at all possible so at the very least he can keep the statue on display. i would hope that between that and any other agreements we come to, he and his family can be at peace. i'm posting this here because i can't find anything on this statue and was wondering if anyone can here help me identify a replacement for the head in this [picture](http://imgur.com/qxztjgf).

my fiancee and i are currently long-distance (across multiple time zones, big time difference), with me organizing my move to her country next year. we spent our longest time apart recently - 6 months without seeing each other - and i was visiting her for 3 weeks, although we both had to work for 2 of those 3 weeks. as you can probably imagine, we were both pretty affection and love-starved.

a few days before i had to leave, we were in bed at night half-watching some bad movie on tv. i was exhausted - we hadn't been sleeping much for the entire week - and i was on the verge of falling asleep. we were happily cuddling, and my fiancee noticed i was falling asleep and started protesting, telling me not to fall asleep that she wanted to cuddle more. i sleepily said, ""i'm not asleep yet, i'm just really tired."" after a little more protesting that i was leaving soon, i made up my mind to stay awake. after all, she was right, i was leaving soon and wanted to make the most of the time we had left. mistake.

as you can guess, we started making out. but i was just dead tired - and when i get past a certain point of tiredness, my body just takes over and i sleep no matter what. i dozed off... in the middle of a makeout session. and woke up a few minutes later to an understandably pissed fiancee.

this morning a couple came in looking to buy a bike and i so i started helping them. they seemed to be pretty well to do since they didn't really bat an eye at the cost of the bikes and were saying the woman looking for a bike should treat herself. this is good and bad because it means they are very likely to buy something but are very likely to be difficult to help. they wanted to try just about every version of the bike they were looking at to make sure it was right (even riding different colors just to be sure). after about an hour of helping them, they decided to buy a medium black and green quick 4 for $750 as well as a new seat and water bottle holder bringing the total to over $800 before tax. i was feeling pretty good about getting that sale done.

then near the end of the day, a man and his son came in saying that they were here to buy the bike they were going to buy yesterday but had to wait for the manager to assemble it. i asked what it was and the father said it was a medium black and green quick 4. i discreetly told the manager who'd stayed after closing yesterday to assemble the bike for him. so then he had to tell the man that we'd sold the bike earlier today because no one had told me about it. the man was very upset and left saying he'd never spend money here again. luckily the manager wasn't upset with me, he was more upset with how the man was so upset. so i still haven't fucked up this job but i'll let you guys know if i do.",1,exploration,work,tldr

i excuse myself from the table and sit on the can. not a second later the brown waterfall begins splashing into the water, accompanied by sounds which i never thought my stimach would be capable of making. this continued for roughly 25 minutes, with short pauses in between the torrential shitstorms. i could hear the sounds of fidgeting and discomfort coming from the other room, and by the end i felt embarrassed but extremely relieved.

i work at a huge waste disposal site, and i have the responsibility for all the hazardous waste that comes in. so today was just a regular day, sorting out all the hazardous waste like paint, oil, batteries etc. when i was done sorting everything out i took myself a well deserved break. 
so i was sitting in my chair casually reading the daily newspaper when suddenly the valve for the emergency fire hose exploded. apparently the water pressure had been on the entire time which ended flooding the entire station. there wasn't much i could do since the only person who knew where the main switch for the water supply was my boss. 

this is where everything went to shit. beneat the emergency fire hose was a huge fuse-box to power the entire station, well all i can is that it broke pretty damn fast. now my boss blamed me for not turning the pressure off which ended in me getting fired. so now i'm at home playing league of legends and listening to bruce springsteen.",3,exploration,relationship,tldr

i was driving home and could only see the person's lights in front of me. luckily i knew where i was going, and turned into my neighborhood. but i forget one thing about my neighborhood. the entrance, it floods like crazy. so, with my old car (27 years old?) i drive through this puddle which i could not see. i felt like i was in a boat for an instance but got luckily made it home o.k.

fast forward a day later and i'm driving to work and my car starts to rev back and forth, so i go to pull over and it completely stalls out. well, called my parents and my dad got it home fine. let it dry out, he said.

it didn't. finally i'm driving back to campus and stall out in an intersection, gas smell and i can't move the fucking wheel. parents once again came to save the day and somehow my dad got it back to campus by putting it in neutral. he said it stalled out on him about 50 times.

first a little background information: two years ago my family and i celebrated christmas in the states (we're from europe). and my dad and i are big fans of disney and have always wanted a glorious tree with bright colors and lights in green, blue, red and yellow, and you can't really get them where i'm from. so of course we had to buy some when we were in the states, and buy some i mean around 200 of them. 

anyways: come yesterday and my brother and i are decorating the tree. we start with the lights (as always), and when we have put them up we realize we need an electrical transformer. no problem, we bought one in the states and i take charge for fixing the right settings. i thought it shouldn't be that difficult and it wasn't. soon enough the tree was brightly shining in 4 different colors. as we continued the decoration of the tree my brother pointed out that the lights were getting a little hot. i thought nothing of it really. until 2 hours later. thats when all the lights one after one died pretty fast and they wouldn't turn on again. turns out in the us you use 110v, but i had plugged it in at 220v burning them all out... so no disney tree this christmas. my mom is happy because she thought the lights were horrible.",3,part3,relationship,tldr

a brit abroad in new hampshire, i was spending the day with my family on a beautiful, if slightly crowded, lakeside beach. it being a swelteringly hot day, i decided to go for a swim. now i'm quite a strong swimmer and decided to challenge myself to go all the way along the beach without stopping. naturally, i had my head down and was pretty determined, although about 2/3 of the way round, i was starting to get pretty tired, to the point where it was no longer fun. out of the corner of my eye, i'd noticed a few people on the shore giving me funny looks as well, so i figured my technique had gone to hell and i was flapping about like a dying fish.

with all this in mind, when i came up for air to find a few more people standing near me (importantly, i was between them and the shore), i gave up, fancying a rest and a bit of a chat.

""lovely day for it, isn't it!""
""yeah, guess it is...""
""you local?""
""yup...""
""wow, must be amazing to live near a place like this!""
""...""

i was baffled! i'd always thought americans were supposed to be friendly, but two of the three decent looking gentlemen were staring straight past me, while the third glowered at me with an intensity normally reserved for tarantino films. all in all, it put me off my swim completely, so i turned for shore...

...and bumped straight into the pastor, lifting the young lad who was being baptised out of the water. down the three of us went together, in an almighty (pardon the pun) splash of limbs. i cannot underestimate the size of the crowd i had somehow failed to notice watching. although the pastor found it funny, the kid seemed utterly horrified (if you fall over during your baptism, do you go to hell?) and his parents weren't much happier.

anyway, that's not the fuck up. as i didn't know and i hadn't wet anybody myself, one of the guys who i've met a few times before said i could throw water at him as he was last for this to happen to on a previous year and he wanted me to be involved. so i was given a mug of water and i threw it at him. however, my hand was wet from being soaked and i wasn't holding the mug by the handle. so i ended up throwing the whole fucking mug by accident. the shot was perfect. for his face. fuck. bruise on his nose. 

he was a bit startled but took it well though. he said it and he was okay, and i apologised profusely but everyone said don't worry, it's a new story to tell people. he might have a headache this morning though... 

in case you were worried about the mug, it didn't break. it fell straight on to concrete and somehow just rolled... crazy physics.

relationship with my boss, we hang out on weekends and he’s the best employer iv ever had, couldn’t ask for better. 

so today we had a very hot day, 35 degrees (95 for the americans). instead of our usual duty’s i was tasked with fitting a flatbed truck with a water tank that we’ve had in storage for a while. 

the day was going sweet, i spent all day drilling and fitting the frame, cleaning, painting and generally doing a great job. 

half hour before we’re due to finish up for the day everyone had assembled back at the workshop, including the boss, the last thing to do was to lift the big plastic tank onto the truck using our crane truck, which is basically a big truck with all the things you could ever need to do our work along with an expensive palfinger crane (for those who are interested)

anyway while we’re manoeuvring everything into position i have to lower the tank to re adjust a sling, the controls for the crane are at the side of the truck and we’re lifting directly over the front of the cab, so i’m relying a lot on two other guys to make sure everything’s going to plan. 

all of a sudden as i’m lowering it to the ground i here a crunch and see shards of glass falling on the floor. my heart sank, all the days work fell apart in a second. from great day to potentially $150,000 bill which i take full responsibility for as i was on the controls.

"greetings! younger reddit browser here to share a story from a day or two ago.

midterms were amongst us, and on this particular day i had my physical education course's exam. the exam was made up of three parts, all under a [pacing program]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5vvroplaw4&feature=youtube_gdata_player): running (linked), push ups, and curl ups. this story revolves around the curl ups.

my friend and i had just returned from doing the push up test, and has decided to get the other ""easy"" test out of the way.  we were part of the last group of people to go up at that time.

after minutes of anticipation, we get set up to start the test.

i lift myself up from the mat, to feel a very distinctive rumble in my nether regions.

*oh, fuck no.*

at a very young age, i thought i had the ability to perform ""automatic farts"" (that's a story for another time; i was one of the weird but kind of cool kids), and would always be quite the entertainment source for friends and family members. until a later age, i never realized i was, in fact, performing queefs. from the years of doing this, i gained quite the exquisite muscle ability in these regions. with such power, it sometimes became abit... uncontrollable.

the muscle contractions from performing these curl ups were causing me to queef.

i was, luckily, saved by the blaring speakers placed right next to my testing mat. but i fear a couple were quite audible- considering the look on one of the coaches faces whilst i was leaving the test area.

i do not have this teacher, but who knows if he'll keep this to himself.

""ah, amazon has everything!, but would they actually have an isis flag?!"" well, of course i would not dare buy one or hang one up, that's in really poor taste in my opinion but of course i just haaaad to search for it. 

turns out, they don't carry them! i guess that's a relief, i don't think people should be buying those, so whatever, right? i go on with my day! the next thing i know i see two cop cars pull up and my manager walk outside and talk to them. what could be going on? this is a small office where our manager and employees do minimal work and bullshit over beers most of the time. i surely would have heard something popping off in the office, right?

turns out my boss can see everything that is done on our work computers. he uses one of those programs that teachers in schools use to monitor their students progress and make sure they're not slacking off. he saw me make multiple search queries on isis flags and decided to call the police.

after being escorted out of the building and taken around the corner for a talk with the officers, after much convincing and a sheer stroke of luck, i was allowed to go home.

"technically my other half's fu, but i thought i'd share anyway.

last night i was sitting at home when there was a knock at the door. it was the neighbour, dropping off a box of chocolates to thank us for looking after their dog for the past week. i took the box, a bit confused, thanked him, and shut the door.

my partner turned to me with a look of dread on his face. turns out the neighbour had asked him last weekend to feed and water their dog for the upcoming week while they were on holidays. and my partner forgot about it almost the very second they asked him.

the dog is fine, but it very possibly could have been a much sadder ending. my partner is actually the worst person in the world, and we now have a box of chocolates that taste like guilt.

 

update: spoke to the neighbour and explained what happened, he was really understanding about it all. the dog is an outdoor cattle dog, and both his food and water bowls were filled before the family left, so turns out he didn't starve, and is the same happy, healthy, playful self. we have our own dogs, and it's heartbreaking to both of us what could have happened, but fortunately no harm done.",1,exploration,work,documents

"so this actually happened this morning before work. i've been staying at my parent's house since my dad has been sick. we've been trying to keep an eye on him. in the guest room there is my old bunk bed and a futon; for a while, id been sleeping on the futon because i'm 26 and felt like i was too old to use a bunk bed. that lasted about two weeks, or until last night, when i decided that i'm old enough to not care if i'm childish sometimes lol. so i slept on the bunk bed, and of course, it had to be the top bunk. my parents live in a small place so the bed nearly reaches the ceiling anyway. slept like a baby. my alarm scared the shit out of me when it went off and i jumped up like usual, hitting my head full force on the damn ceiling. like a five-year-old who just had their toy taken from them, i screamed for my mom immediately. i hear her running up the steps and i'm still a little fuzzy; she tries to open the door but my shit is all over the place and its not budging. starting to realize i'm fine and not five, i shout that i'm fine but its too late. she pushes the door open with all her might and it gets stuck on some clothes; she trips and hits her head on the steel bars of the bed and now i feel like shit because of it. she's holding back tears and rubbing her head while asking if i'm okay, i tell her i'm fine and am apologizing like crazy. then my dumbass tries to get off the bed and misses the bar causing me to do a split...i'm not flexible at all. so now i'm shouting obscenities and i cant tell if she's laughing or crying. eventually, i got down and everyone was fine. the day was decidedly spent (by my mom) sitting in the living room and talking about how i've always been clumsy and she finds it hilarious. i really can't wait to just go back home to my apartment and pretend this never happened.",2,exploration,relationship,tldr

"background story: i'm 22 y.o. male home from school for winter break. a few weeks ago my brother came to visit with my 1 month old nieces. this was the first time they were at my house, and also the first time i was meeting them (my parents had already met them). of course, we took hundreds of pictures on a number of different cameras and phones. my mom wanted a consolidated folder for all of the pictures, so i suggested creating a dropbox shared folder for the pictures. i didn't have my computer at the moment so i used my mom's computer to import all of the pictures, then logged into dropbox through her browser and created a shared folder for the family. 

so, last night i walk upstairs and see my mom on her computer. i say hi to her but she doesn't respond and seems focused on the computer and annoyed/unhappy. i ignore it and go to the kitchen to make some food(10 feet away), when a few minutes later she tells me she thinks i accidentally left my dropbox logged in on her computer. oh shit, all my phone's pictures are automatically synced as soon as they are taken. she went to dropbox.com to log into her account to look at the baby pictures i shared, but i was still logged in. i ask how much she went through and she said not much, she was just looking for the baby pictures (the baby pics were towards te top). she lied...when i take the computer to log out i see she is all the way down to sept. 2011, and dropbox has the pictures in chronological order.

with a grimaced face she says, ""there are some things in there you should delete."" i have some pictures that she would not approve of to say the least. oh yeah, and i was just smoking in the basement 10 minutes earlier of which i happened to snap a nice selfie (would have been the first picture she saw). she also definitely knew i was just munching hard. sweet.",2,part3,relationship,tldr

fast forward a few weeks and she's having a christmas party for people at the state house, her place of work, and for the future speaker of the house. there were also a lot of state reps, and people of high interest there who had brought their families, so we were told to act our best. after the party had started moving into the main room, we decided to go into one of the back room closets where the items i had ordered were put so they wouldn't get in the way of the party. trying to keep it hidden from the rest of my family members, we went into the closet, closing the doors and locking them. (the inside of the closet has a lock inside of it.) now, this is a fairly large closet, but it's packed pretty full with packaging for the holiday decor, so it's a bit cramped.


unknown to the three of us, my grandmother had decided to give a tour to one of her friends who had yet to see her newer place. eventually, they came to the locked closet and and tried open it, so my friend decided to open the door to the closet. my grandmother introduces her ""grandson and his two friends"" to the former president of a major east coast university.(can i mention his name and the university?) it took us about a half hour to realize what had happened, and how extremely awkward and odd it seemed. he remembered our names, but i'm not sure if that's really something to be proud of.",2,exploration,work,documents

edit: it was about the equivalent of around 10-12 cups apparently. the instant coffee was powder that you just put into hot water, it had about 50mg caffeine in less than a teaspoon of powder and the group holds around 10 teaspoons. so i'm guessing that was almost 0.5g or more of caffeine

quick background- 
  my girlfriend and i met when i first moved to a new area several years ago (closer to 10 than five).  not long after meeting, i was laid off from my job.  by the time we knew we would get married we felt like we needed to be more financially stable before taking the next step.  
  we have now purchased a home together in a new area, and are getting things moving in the right direction.  last weekend while discussing future plans, marriage came up.  i asked her if she ""had any plans next weekend"", and she said ""no"".  it was at that moment i asked her how she would feel about having her anniversary on 12-13-15.  
surprise factor = 100
romance factor = zero

here is where the tifu happens:
because of the short notice, the two of us looked at it as being a legal procedure.  none of our parents live in our state, and we're not religious.  our plan is to meet a few of my relatives and friends who live nearby, and we would get married in a park.  then, next year we would have a planned ceremony and reception for all of our friends and family.
problem is, we are the only two who looked at it this way.  a number of people feel left out, and my mom was very hurt.  had i realized how important this would have been for everyone else, i wouldn't have waited until the last minute to confirm the date.

 

edit*left the last t off of thought.

edit 2- we would have been happy if all those interested in attending could make it but my procrastination didn't leave much time to make plans for the specific day we wanted to marry.

"to all the jewish redditors: happy hanukkah everybody! i made a custom hannukiah for my daughter and i couldn't be prouder. until...
to everyone else: i'll explain

tonight was the second night of hanukkah (spelling? nobody knows). basically hanukkah is a jewish holiday that's celebrated over 8 nights. you also traditionally eat jam doughnuts. that's irrelevant, but nice to know.
anyway, the important bit is that every night, after sunset, you light one more candle on the hannukiah. a hannukiah is a candle-holder/candelabra that holds 8 candles and 1 elevated candle which does all the work called the shamash. these candles dont' last that long - about an hour - but you light another series each night.
most jewish families have a nice and elaborate hannukiah. this thing is a family heirloom and is used only during the holidays. some families have one per family member, some have one for the family.

my daughter is now 3 years old and so i hit upon the incredibly awesome idea of creating a hannukiah just for her out of duplo and sugru. i'm an awesome dad who spent a good afternoon with his girl doing something creative and not watching peppa pig for the millionth time. i'm ready for my award.

that was last week. 

last night was the first night of hanukkah and it worked like a charm!
we had guests so we only let it burn for a few minutes (yes, we're not orthodox and probably broke some rules - that's not the point)

confused, i ask what's going on and they tell me if i don't pay them a couple hundred bucks this recording was going to all my friends and family(my full name was on my skype), and being broke as i was i started freaking out and trying to convince them of my being penniless but they wouldn't have it and started a countdown. freaking out even more, i summoned all the courage i had and told my dad what had happened, and he tells me to call the police about it. so i call the cops and a couple minutes later one is in our living room taking down what had happened. 

oh yeah, i told the scammer i called the cops after being told to do so by my dad and they promptly stopped the countdown and disappeared, but with a policeman there i had to explain why he had been sent to my house. praise be to this man that he did not laugh at the stupid thing i had done. he told me i should call the fbi as the skype account they used had an address on it and apparently this was quite common, but they never found out who it was so i didnt have to go to court to testify or anything.

on the 12th of may i entered into a long distance with louise. we have always had a very strong friendship and this carried over into our relationship. she remains the most amazing person in my life. eventually we make plans for her to come down to my city (she lives in the north of england, 8 hours away from my home in the south west) between today and the 15th. everything looks good, she lives with her mum and it seemed everything was sorted with her. what i didnt realise on the other hand was though louise had told her mum she was going down to the south west they hadnt fully discussed dates which caused a bit of an issue.

so i was on my living room sofa with louise and there was a knock at the door and it was the fucking police, so they come in ask all of us questions including my mum because apparently louise's mum reported her to the local police as a missing person and they found my adress from a letter i had written louise in her room. because her mum didnt know she was going to bristol today she got really pissed off and demanded louise go back to the north. so long story short she's on her way back home now with the police and i am devastated because my perfect weekend is ruined. i have full trust in louise and i know she didnt intentionally run away from home. i just want this to be sorted out.

"ok so this happened when i was in elementary school during recess. sorry if the formatting is bad as i'm on mobile.

so it all started when me and a group of friends were all talking about which girls we liked. this one guy, we'll call him chris, said that he liked this girl called sam. no big deal right? well, this group of three girls who had no relationship with sam that overheard us thought it would be cute to tell sam that chris liked her. so they started running off towards the blacktop (we were at the playground) to tell her. chris starts following them to prevent this. now this is where things get frisky.

me being the bro i am, i start sprinting towards the girls to try and prevent chris's exposure. keep in mind that i am insanely fast. i catch up with them and kick out my feet at one of the girls and trip her and she goes flying and eats shit on the grass. ""haha one down two more to go"" i exclaim. at this point i think the whole thing is really funny until the girl i tripped starts bawling her eyes out and it's just then i realize she has mud and grass stains all over her outfit. oh shit. i quickly dip back to the playground to my friends where they're all laughing at me and i try to think of story to save my ass.

well recess ends and in the next class i get called to the principals office. fuck. our principal asks so what happened during recess? ""well, i was really hungry so i ran toward the blacktop to go inside and i accidentally bumped into jess on my way there"". so why did you say one down two more to go? ""well, i was embarrassed so i just said that"". it took half an hour of my principal to emotionally break me down for me to crack. it ended up in me writing a letter apologizing to jess and a letter to the principal explaining why we shouldn't lie and my parents grounded me for a month so i couldn't go out on mischief night, go ghosting and trick or treating.",4,evaluation,relationship,documents

"so last night/this morning i fucked up big style and almost lost two of my close friends and likely pissed off others. 
how one bad decision leads to another. i've been ill for a while, haven't been sleeping or eating properly either but decide to drink.  want to drink cocktails , thought given recent drinking times i'd be fine and controlled.
nope, i ended up a wasted state.
have been in love with my close friend for years (who i'll just call 'a'),  but i am in a relationship with his best friend (have been for years). this is an open secret however and it is also known that a has feelings for another close friend  of mine ('b'). i also know a used to have feelings for me. of recent, a had been a total dick to me repeatedly so i was already feeling wound up. my frustrations were with him being a shity friend but obviously given the situation it is hard not to and can be justified to jump to the conclusion that his shittiness is due to our past.
so this cocktail of bad decisions is then tested by seeing a give b lots of special treatment and fawning. b has no interest in a and i feel like a is being disrespectful to me by his actions. other close friends bring up with me frequently how a's actions to b are weird and obvious as well as a's actions to me are obvious. should point out that a being so overt is really unusal and he's not had a girlfriend in all the time i've known him or any romantic entanglements besides that i've mentioned.  
so, something in me has snapped and what do i do in my drunken tequila induced state and do not remember? i want to make a hurt how i hurt, so i start slinging really vicious insults about b to a. i said some awful things , words i'd never use otherwise and not even used to describe people i don't actually even like.
a has thrown a drink on me, i attempted to physically retaliate, b has overheard all the horrible shit i have said. 
so i stormed out and got a taxi home and proceeded to cry and get in contact with people at 7am to cry some more because i am sick of feeling anything for a.",3,evaluation,relationship,documents
"a little context first. i live out of home and still regularly visit my family household. for most of those visits i find it a lot easier if i stay the night instead of taking public transport back home. my dad has been renovating the house for many years, and so he uses my old room as storage for a lot of building materials. so if i want to stay over i have to sleep on the couch, which can get uncomfortable and hot.

i couldn't get to sleep easily, so i decided to lay awake until my sister woke up to go to work (she has to leave for work at 3am) and take her comfy double bed with a plethora of pillows.

once she finished getting ready for work and left, i immediately got up and into her room. i noticed she left her sheets and pillows in a mess, so i start rearranging them. the first thing i do is move her main pillow from where it lay, and my hands catch an object underneath.

i placed the pillow aside and look in horror as i've just picked up my sister's vibrator. large, pink vibrator.
immediately i drop it, turn the light off, back out of the room, and washed my hands for i don't know how long. there wasn't enough soap in the world.

my efforts to have a ridiculously comfy sleep turned into one of my hardest sleeps ever.

"this happened a few hours ago. (on mobile so sorry for shit formatting and errors)

okay so i had an assignment draft due today. nothing big, just two pages but i decided i might as well staple it anyway, just in case it gets lost. 

i go to staple it and what do i find? my stapler is empty. no biggie, i'll just refill it. 

i go to close the stapler and my brilliant self thought it was a great idea to place my thumb where the staples come out. 

a few seconds later i feel a sharp pain on my thumb so i pull my hand away and with it comes the stapler. 

yes, friends. i stapled my thumb to the stapler. 

i lean over to my friend and quietly tell her that i have royally fucked myself and, being the good friend she is, she yells across the library to our teacher that i have stapled my thumb. 

my teacher comes over and immediately starts panicking because i have a stapler attached to my thumb. she sends my friend and another teacher with me to the nurse. 

half way there the stapler detaches itself but there is still a staple imbedded in my thumb. 

we get to the nurse and she starts laughing at the sheer  ridiculousness of the situation. she gives me a bandaid and some dettol and tells me to pull it out. 

i grab the staple and pull. immediately blood starts pouring out of the tiny holes because if how deep the staple had gone in. i wipe the blood away and put the bandaid on. 

the nurse gives me a note to show that i've been to her, on which she writes ""stapled finger"".  

i get back to my class and i glue the staple to the note because why not. then i decide to actually staple my assignment. i look through it to make sure everything is there and what do i find? the second page is blank. i didn't need to staple my assignment at all. 

this whole situation could have been avoided if i had just checked my work first.

i get to the room and awake the one-eyed snake. the lack of masturbating for almost 3 weeks has taken it's toll and i end up finishing quickly and making quite a mess. in my post-wank madness i decide it would be a good idea to go for round two, considering i've missed valuable time over the last few weeks. after round two (which is considerably longer and dryer than round one), i notice a bit of a cut at the top of my johnny rocket, but i write it off, i've dealt with worse and i can deal with this.

fast forward to a few hours later, and my family decides to head over to the beach for a swim, to which i begrudgingly oblige, forgetting my 'injury'. as i step into the sea water, all seems fine, until i realise my fatal mistake. at first a tiny papercut on my finger starts to sting, but this is nothing compared to the pain that is about to come. it takes about 2 minutes before the tingling starts. the tingling turns into a stinging and the stinging turns into a severe pain. i bolt out of the water, grab a towel and run back to the hotel. i'm now sitting on a deck chair, with my knob throbbing, wondering how the hell i'm going to explain my sudden disappearance.",3,part3,relationship,tldr

so basically, me and my girlfriend have been going out for 2 years now, and we've had a pretty rocky relationship until now but i love her and she loves me, but by now it should probably be ""loved"". so anyway, my girlfriend wanted to play some hearthstone together, for anyone who isnt familiar with hs, its a card game made by blizzard. so we planned to play it over a new app called discord instead of skype. discord is basically an application where you can communicate over the internet through text and mic just like skype but with better features and not as laggy as skype. on discord you are able to change the name of the different rooms you create. so being myself and wanting to have a nice laugh with my girlfriend, i made the room names suggestive towards my girlfriend's lady parts. this where my fuck up happens. so i made the room and everything, all i had to do now is message my girlfriend on hearthstone the link to my brand new room on discord called ""girlfriends ____hole"". i think you can figure out what the blank line could represent. so i messaged her saying that i made the room, sent her the link and told her to join ""girlfriends ____hole"", but this is where my stupidity hits. instead of messaging her, i accidentally messaged her brother. boom it hits me too late and i go full on panic mode. i messaged my girlfriend about this problem, (just to let you know her brother is pretty overprotective over her and doesn't like it when people objectify her) and she responded to me telling me she would talk to him etc. so she comes back to me and we had a pretty heated argument. ended on bad terms with her and possibly could have ended the relationship and making her brother think im a sex offender. sigh.

"this fuck up happened around november to december of 2014, but it started around august of that same year. i had just started my senior year of high school, 17yo male and was feeling pretty good at the time. i had never had a relationship prior to this encounter, and i can't remember how exactly we met each other rather than having heard that a junior girl had taken interest in me. now, this came as quite the surprise, considering the fact that i was a skinny white kid that was not only incredibly introverted, but also a little bit socially awkward with very little self-confidence.

anyway, one day we started talking, one thing led to another, and we were eventually dating. (oh yes, high school dating). so, the relationship seemed to progress as normal (or at least what i assumed to be normal, based on the fact that i never had a prior relationship up to that point in my life). well, one night, we we're over at my house watching a movie and ended up starting to kiss, and then proceeded to cuddle. it was during that point in which i took the time to say ""i love you"", and she seemed fine with it at the time and said it back.

now remember, i'm a socially awkward introvert with no prior dating experience. the only reason i said that was because of the fact that i wanted to show her that i appreciated her taking interest in me and spending time with, being with me, caring about me.

well, in about 1 months time this relationship continued, nothing seemed out of the ordinary, and then the day that finals ended and i was searching for the perfect christmas present on etsy, (which was this really neat handmade bracelet with polymer clay animals), she texted me saying that she needed to stop over and it would only take a minute. then she dumped me, with no explanation other than that she didn't feel comfortable that i told her i loved her, despite that she never communicated this with me. so there i was, christmas approaching, feeling heartbroken, alone, and depressed. i mean, looking back, at least i passed all my exams with flying colors. so i had that going for me, which is nice.",1,evaluation,work,tldr

i decided to try another browser to see if that shed any light, and the comments were unchanged! then i remembered that, ages ago, i installed the downworthy addon to chrome, which basically changes the clickbait titles of those shitty buzzfeed articles you see on facebook. it had been picking out certain words in my comments and replacing them (not in the actual comment just so that i would see them differently) and so i've wasted a bunch of time and now have a bunch of new passwords to remember. i am an idiot.",3,exploration,work,documents

finally, after two months since it was scheduled, my test was today. the test wasn't until four, so i spent the whole day checking and rechecking that everything was perfect. i went over everything twice with my mom, just to be certain. at three o'clock, she and i hopped into my sister's car - mine has a wonky speedometer - and drove to the dmv.

we spent an hour and half waiting for the instructor. in that time, my paperwork was processed and approved. everyone was so kind and trying to help me relax. i was finally called for the vehicle inspection, so out we went.

we were given five minutes (they close at five and the test would take 20 minutes) to email her the correct card. mom couldn't remember her password for the company's website and no other family member would pick up their phones.

i go up behind her, and i kind of poke her shoulders and go ""rah"". 

have you ever seen a guy in a movie get punched in the face and they fall to the ground and you think, that's fake?

it's fake, but not impossible.

laney turns around (instinctively) and punches me in the face, to which knocks me in the mud. she goes ""i'm so sorry! why did you do that?!?!?"" i apologized, and told her she didn't need to apologize for me being a dick.",3,exploration,work,documents

"this happened on a saturday morning, a lovely morning it was... .i switched on my computer to start binge watching a whole lot of movies. 2 hours later i decide to open steam to check what's new and who's on. to my surprise i see a message popping up and i quickly open it to see what's all the fuss about. it was my friend and what he had to say made the rest of the day a living hell. he asked me about my exams and their dates. 

so i checked on my university's website to tell him the dates. after a long few scrolls, i ended up on my subject's timings and found that the two subjects share the same date except in the timing department one is after the other. i twist my head gradually to the bottom right corner of the monitor to find the current date & time. turns out it was the same exact date. i try to reason with myself that this was an error in the system or no one puts exams on weekend but i remembered that the last few semesters had exams on a saturday. that's when i started to panic and sob uncontrollably knowing i missed the two exams. 

even if i had fever i would never miss exams let alone a test. i tried everything from getting a fake sick leave to coming up with a letter suggesting i wasn't mentally stable to write the papers. unfortunately, none of these worked.",4,exploration,work,tldr
"ok so this fu actually happened new year's eve. me and my friend went to another friends party, thinking it would be a fun time. well at said party there were only couples sucking face and no music... lame. so me and said friend called up another friend we'll call him ""jimito"" and i feel i should stress how mexican his family is. anyways we head out to his house and ditch lame party. here is where the fu begins. it was pretty dark outside so i couldn't tell which house was his. but, i see this mexican smoking outside and i kinda recognize him. i proceed to knock on the door. this guy laughs a bit and tells me and my friend to head on in. i am pretty good friends with jimito so we head on in. when we arrive inside, there has to be at least 50 people inside. they all stop what they are doing and stare into our souls. i proceed to creep on to ""jimito's room"", but when i open the door all that is inside is workout equipment. now i'm not saying jimito is fat, but... it's obvious this dude does workout... ok he is a little fat. so i realize, this isn't his room. i turn to my friend that was still behind me clueless that this is the wrong house and mutter under my breath ""turn around, this is the wrong house."" so when we get back to the main room everyone is staring at us. no one says a word for 30 seconds(boy was that shit awkward) until i stutter out ""sorry... wrong house"" and we walk out in silence. then the smoking guy outside whips out his cigarette and says to us ""wrong house eh?"". i respond with a stone cold ""ya"" and while we walk to jimito's house all we hear is ""hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha"".
