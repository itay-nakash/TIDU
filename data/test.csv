42_2_1,"some back story:
i have dated my now ex for over 4 years. first real relationship i've ever had and the first girl i've ever really loved. we meet each other at the worst point in my life and she really helped me through some stuff.

now my fu:
i've been feeling really weird about our relationship recently, as we haven't seen each other much over the past few months and she's been rather cold toward me lately. i woke up this morning feeling very off and just really down. i spent the whole being bummed out and depressed, until the whole thought started to feel kinda silly. she was having a barbecue at her house, and not really wanting to create a scene over there, i asked her to call me after everyone left because i just wanted to talk to her. i've been really missing her and haven't seen her a lot due to school and work and family, so i figured that was probably ask it was. i was wrong. 

i called her when she said most everyone had left and told her i felt silly even asking, but i wanted her to be honest. ""do you still even want to be with me anymore?"" as soon as i said it, i realized i was just being paranoid and awaited her downpour of love and reassurance. i, again, was wrong. instead, she responded with silence, a deep, heavy sigh, and said ""i don't know. i was gonna come over tomorrow to talk with you, and i'd rather do this in person. but you and i are just at different places right now, and i think i just need to be by myself right now."" god damn, that came out of nowhere! i've never been hit so hard in my life! that's nowhere near what i was expecting!

after a few more minutes of teary conversation and some very difficult text messages in the following hours, she's coming over to drop off some stuff and answer some questions.",1
229_2_2,"okay, so i haven't gone out with friends in a while cause i've been busy with school for the past month or two, so i decided to myself, okay let's take a nice bath and pamper yourself so you feel like the hottest buttslut in the club tonight. i also needed to touch up my hair dye, so a bath works really well to sit around and wait in. 

anyways, because i'm also in a ldr, i really haven't felt the need to impress anyone at all so i've neglected to shave for probably ~6 weeks or so...which has resulted in a nicely fruitful amazon forest. i also just hate shaving and haven't had time.

because of this, i know for a fact the bath water is gonna be full of hair so i grab my cup and use it to rinse the shaver off with. alright, awesome. so i've shaved my legs, armpits, and tacobits and by now you can't even see the water in the cup, it's just a black mass of lady greenery. 

i continue on with the rest of my bath as normal, and then wash my face last. my eyes are closed because of said facial wash and as usual, i reach for my rinsing up. i think you already know where this is going. i thought to myself, oh the cup is already full of water awesome and proceed to dump it on my head.",1

366_2_3,"we're staying at this holiday house with her family. after getting her off, she wants to stop as she's uncomfortable after hearing family moving about upstairs, which my hour-engorged guy-brain isn't happy about. after waiting for her to go to sleep (she's a very deep sleeper), i whip out the computer and go to find something to fap to since i feel like doing it to a sleeping person seems too creepy, at which point she jumps out of bed crying and goes to sleep with her sister. finally manage to talk to her and the love of my life isn't sure she wants to be in a relationship anymore.

48_2_1,"so a bit of backstory, i have two friends (both girls). let's say that their names are both kelly. i have known both for over two years and kelly #2 was/is currently in a relationship with my best friend while kelly #1 was effectively my crush.

anyway, i have both their numbers in my phone under the name kelly. both are two separate contacts with the same name, as i stupidly put it in that way and never bothered to change it. hours ago, i get the bravery to tell kelly #1 my feelings. i had known her for long enough and i thought that she might feel the same. so i go to text her and realize that there were two contacts. instead of playing it safe and confirming which was which (i had recently deleted the old texts off my phone, so there was no conversation to look through to see which was which), i instead take a guess.

lo and behold, i made the wrong choice and end up confessing my love to the wrong kelly, my friends girlfriend no less. so i rush to explain my mistake to her, however before i can even think of how i was going to explain it, kelly #2 texts back and starts talking about how she feels the same and wants to leave my best friend for me. honestly, i have no idea what to do at this point and i am afraid of losing basically my entire social life over this one stupid mistake.",3

41_2_1,"well, this actually happened several years ago at the end of my high school years.  a group of my friends met a group of girls at a waterpark one summer and at the end of the day i exchanged screen names (a screen name or sn was something used as your internet name when instant messaging).  we chatted and we even met up at the same water park the next year.  
right after graduating high school we were talking about getting together and a summer festival was going down in her town, so i planned to go up there that weekend like a 2 hour drive away.  she had just broken up with her boyfriend like a week before i go up there too!  i get up there an we're doing all this stuff together, like frolfing and hanging out and watching movies till 3am.  we went jet skiing one day and got into a 'water fight'.  the whole weekend i don't make a move because she just got out of a relationship, i was actually dating someone at the time, but that one was doomed, but still loyal didn't want to 'do' anything. 
by the way she's a solid 9/10.  missed the chance to at least date her for awhile.",1
110_2_1,"obligatory this wasn't today, exactly - a month or so back.

my fiancee and i are currently long-distance (across multiple time zones, big time difference), with me organizing my move to her country next year. we spent our longest time apart recently - 6 months without seeing each other - and i was visiting her for 3 weeks, although we both had to work for 2 of those 3 weeks. as you can probably imagine, we were both pretty affection and love-starved.

a few days before i had to leave, we were in bed at night half-watching some bad movie on tv. i was exhausted - we hadn't been sleeping much for the entire week - and i was on the verge of falling asleep. we were happily cuddling, and my fiancee noticed i was falling asleep and started protesting, telling me not to fall asleep that she wanted to cuddle more. i sleepily said, ""i'm not asleep yet, i'm just really tired."" after a little more protesting that i was leaving soon, i made up my mind to stay awake. after all, she was right, i was leaving soon and wanted to make the most of the time we had left. mistake.

as you can guess, we started making out. but i was just dead tired - and when i get past a certain point of tiredness, my body just takes over and i sleep no matter what. i dozed off... in the middle of a makeout session. and woke up a few minutes later to an understandably pissed fiancee.

she is awesome, so no relationship issue caused... but now is definitely going to make fun of me for this for the rest of my life. and has a lifetime trump card.",1
407_2_3,"to all the jewish redditors: happy hanukkah everybody! i made a custom hannukiah for my daughter and i couldn't be prouder. until...
to everyone else: i'll explain

tonight was the second night of hanukkah (spelling? nobody knows). basically hanukkah is a jewish holiday that's celebrated over 8 nights. you also traditionally eat jam doughnuts. that's irrelevant, but nice to know.
anyway, the important bit is that every night, after sunset, you light one more candle on the hannukiah. a hannukiah is a candle-holder/candelabra that holds 8 candles and 1 elevated candle which does all the work called the shamash. these candles dont' last that long - about an hour - but you light another series each night.
most jewish families have a nice and elaborate hannukiah. this thing is a family heirloom and is used only during the holidays. some families have one per family member, some have one for the family.

my daughter is now 3 years old and so i hit upon the incredibly awesome idea of creating a hannukiah just for her out of duplo and sugru. i'm an awesome dad who spent a good afternoon with his girl doing something creative and not watching peppa pig for the millionth time. i'm ready for my award.

that was last week. 

last night was the first night of hanukkah and it worked like a charm!
we had guests so we only let it burn for a few minutes (yes, we're not orthodox and probably broke some rules - that's not the point)

tonight we lit it again (2 candles) and i put it safely on the top shelf in the living room while i went into the kitchen to talk to my wife...

cue: fire alarm! house full of black smoke! black ceiling and a melting hannukiah dripping with big flames licking up the shelf!

luckily no one was hurt, and i learnt a valuable lesson - watch more tv and stop doing creative things with your child!",3
335_2_3,"today, i decided that i was going to fix my computer. i'd upgraded straight from windows 7 about a week ago, without doing a clean install, which turned out to be a mistake - i encountered a crap load of driver issues, slow pc, broken programs and all the rest.

 i gave up for the week and went on holiday with my family. i can back today, and told myself that i would just reinstall windows cleanly. i'd wipe my drives and start from scratch, just so nothing could go wrong.

as it turns out, when i started the re-installer, my mouse or keyboard wouldn't work, so i had to boot from a usb, which took an hour to find the right size.

finally, i'd found one, installed the installer and set everything up. it was going well, the install went really quickly, and i finally was relieved to have a functioning windows 10.

#turns out i accidentally installed the 32 bit operating system.

bloody. livid.

i realised this when my computer could only use 4gb of the 8gb of ram i had, and i was suspicious when the initial screen resolution was 720p, but i thought it was just how things were - none of my programs were recognised my my computer, even though they were physically there, which i'm guessing(/hoping) is the issue of it.

anyways, here in after 4 hours of uninstalling and backing up and reinstalling all sorts of shit, only to find that i have to do it all again.

it's 3 in be morning, and i'm just utterly defeated...

 

fuck my life.",3
255_2_2,"so, basically, i posted a picture of myself on facebook showing my progress in regards to losing weight over the past 5 or 6 months.  it was all thanks to two friends of mine who motivated me to go to the gym and continue to push myself.  without them, i couldn't be any happier than i was before, up until this point.  once i posted my progress on facebook, he came along and asked ""no love for your personal trainer?""  so, i thought i would just joke around with him and thanked him on my picture, which said ""thanks to this guy because i don't know...""  50% to 60% of our conversations have always been joking around, so i thought it was just for fun posting this.  apparently, he didn't think it was a joke and took me seriously.  i updated my post of the picture, showing my true appreciation by thanking him along with some other friends, but he decided to untag himself, which i was confused about.

after i got out of work, i planned to work out with him, because that's what we usually do after both of us got nothing going on for the rest of the day.  when i saw him, he said ""get out of my sight, what you did was bullshit.""  i asked him what's wrong, and it was directed at that facebook post.  i told him i was just joking around, but he said ""just work out on your own.""  feeling displeased, i decided to just leave the gym. 

he basically doesn't want to see me anymore.  a close friend of mine for so long, no longer wanting to see more, all because of some stupid joke i posted on facebook.  i lost the motivation to go to the gym further up to this point and i keep saying to myself it's all my fault.  i promised myself to never make any more senseless or fun jokes, regardless of whoever i'm talking to.",2
39_2_1,"little bit of background: winter 2013 college semester i started to fall for this girl that i meet through a mutual friend. fast forward to a week after school gets out, she goes home for the summer and i start working third shift, gotta make the money, so she breaks up with me. a week later she starts going out with her friend from back home who she ""wanted to go out before but didn't want to get into a ld relationship, but its cool now because this year he will be going to a local community college that is near the college we go to.""

ok, now back to today, yesterday ex-gf wants to hang out for a bit as we are going to try to just be friends as there wasn't much relationship before we broke up. so i hang out with her and the old feelings resurface in me, time to gtfo and have some whiskey. 

so today i went to football tailgating at the college i go to, hot greek little sister walks up with her friend ""hey bigwag91, this is my friend hotgurl, blah blah blah, she just got out of a two year relationship. she is just looking to hang out. had i not been thinking about last night (or maybe the hangover of today) i would have seen this as a total green light on hotgurl. later hotgurl is talking to me alot giving little hints that i should have noticed but i couldn't muster myself together enough to take these hints and lay some moves on hotgurl.

later on i ended up having to go up to here and apologize for acting like a complete idiot in front of her and we got to talking. ex lovers, friends, interests, etc, etc. the ex lovers part was the worst cause after talking for 45-60 minutes she looks and me and goes ""you will find someone, don't worry"" but gives major hints that i missed my chance. 

 

p.s. ""today"" is actually yesterday

91_2_1,"this happened 3 days ago.
a little background story: i met this girl online and dated her for 2-3 weeks before breaking up. never met her, still haven’t and don’t plan on doing so and all my friends know about this. 

 i was having spanish class and she being the cool teacher she is, she decides to stop class 20-30 minutes earlier and asks about our lives. she goes around the class and asks us questions. 

my turn, great. ""mr. /u/barra420, do you have a girlfriend?"" i answer, ""i used to"" she then asks what happened. (i met this girl online and started dating her without ever meeting her, yeah i know, what the fuck) i proceed to tell her the story of how i met her and she goes batshit crazy. “so you mean you dated this girl that for all you know could be a man? how do you know she wasn’t a pedo or something like that? should i talk to the school counselor?” all those types of questions.

i start explaining myself, every single guy in the class by now is laughing their brains off. the girls look at me like i just shit on the bible and waved a confederate flag in front of a black priest. 
after my explanation she decides to change topic and asks what i do on my free time. i answered that i really enjoyed watching movies and spending time on the computer. she then says “i see, so you enjoy watching porn” every single person in the classroom bursts in laughter. 
guess you can say i have a long year forward with her bringing my online girlfriend up all the time.

 

edit: didn't date her, i talked to her, nothing serious, never told her i loved her or anything. i just say we dated because there isn't a word to describe our relationship.",1
248_2_2,"background: i just started working at a cycling shop full time for the summer so that i can have some extra money. i'm still a new employee and it's my first job so i'm trying to do my best.

this morning a couple came in looking to buy a bike and i so i started helping them. they seemed to be pretty well to do since they didn't really bat an eye at the cost of the bikes and were saying the woman looking for a bike should treat herself. this is good and bad because it means they are very likely to buy something but are very likely to be difficult to help. they wanted to try just about every version of the bike they were looking at to make sure it was right (even riding different colors just to be sure). after about an hour of helping them, they decided to buy a medium black and green quick 4 for $750 as well as a new seat and water bottle holder bringing the total to over $800 before tax. i was feeling pretty good about getting that sale done.

then near the end of the day, a man and his son came in saying that they were here to buy the bike they were going to buy yesterday but had to wait for the manager to assemble it. i asked what it was and the father said it was a medium black and green quick 4. i discreetly told the manager who'd stayed after closing yesterday to assemble the bike for him. so then he had to tell the man that we'd sold the bike earlier today because no one had told me about it. the man was very upset and left saying he'd never spend money here again. luckily the manager wasn't upset with me, he was more upset with how the man was so upset. so i still haven't fucked up this job but i'll let you guys know if i do.",1

we arrived at the airport with 2 hours to spare thankfully, but when it came to tsa checking our ids i didn't have mine. after a discussion with one of the officers they told me they would let me through but i had to answer a bunch of personal questions to make sure i was who i said i was, despite my picture being on my dad's credit card and the fact that i look almost identical to him. 

it took about an hour to get through security and i was able to make the flight. however, i was warned by tsa they can only do this kind of once. this is a problem since i also had to fly back from florida after the vacation. 

we have our fun in florida at universal studios and disneyworld but the time came to go back home. we went to the airport and were met again with the id issue. the officer i talked to was nice enough to let me do the identification again, but told me i was put on a list at homeland security and would be detained if i ever tried to fly without an id again.",3

that's when someone says ""ah malaysian airlines, perfect choice for a guy looking to disappear.""

i work in it, i should know better than to have a drink at my desk but well... it's a very casual work environment, and i was thirsty. not casual enough i can spray my desk with a few ounces of diet pepsi though, which happened just as loudly and violently as possible. 

my coworkers panic and think i'm gagging, so they all come over. i'm frantically trying to clean up before it touches any paperwork or fucks up my work computer. none of that's touched, but the 60$ apple keyboard i use is drenched.

me: ""uhh...""

after this 15 minutes or so of pure, unprecedented torture, my dad came to pick me up. my lips felt really swollen, but i thought it would just go down on the way home, wrong. 
i had a very visible bruise on my upper lip for a week. i tried to play it off like he had elbowed me while playing some intense just dance, my family saw through that.

after out performance, we were all hanging out outside eating street vendor food and talking or whatever, while the couple is eating each others faces out. our band director is no where to be seen, so me and two of my friends decide to screw with the couple. 
this is where we fucked up. to get the couple to stop eating their faces out, we got some pennies and threw them at them, lightly. we had no intentions to hurt them. 
supposedly, the girl in the couple thought we were calling her a prostitute by throwing pennies at her, so the next day we get called into our assistant principals office. we get a lecture on how not to be sexual predators, and how if this happened in a workplace we'd all be fired and labeled as predators. we all also got a detention.",3

anyways, my machine uses glue and i had a spot on my glue pattern that wasn't transferring right. usually it's a piece of glue stuck somewhere, and this was no different. so i went to fix it, usually doesn't require getting into the machine and can be fixed while running without putting yourself in danger. as i was getting up, my head is violently yanked backwards and i hear my paper web snap as my head hits the machine. searing pain followed by my machine stopping occurred. i got up cursing like a drunk sailor, and look at what devastation my hair has wrought on my machine. paper web is broken, paper is everywhere, i'm gonna have to re web it(which is a royal pita...) and then i notice the blood. not a lot, but enough to make me feel the back of my head, which is bleeding pretty good. didn't pull much hair out, just cracked my skull pretty good. ended up needing three stitches as well. thankfully the machine was fine though, other than needing to be webbed up again.",1

117_2_1,"so my best friend likes my 2nd cousin. i've been trying to get them together for a few weeks now but she just isn't warming up to him so i meet up with her in person. (we live quite closeby in the countryside.) we decided to rendez-vous at the graveyard. we sit down on the edge of a grave because there's nowhere else to sit. i'm trying to persuade her into getting with my friend when she tells me to close my eyes. i comply and badda bing baddo boom we're making out. on somebody's grave. so the grave is covered by one large flag-stone. she pushes me back onto it in the middle of our passionate kissing and the fucking flag cracks down the middle and breaks in two. it's in a v-shape. we both proceeded to run out of there.

gladly we got away with it. 

 

edit: against my libido's better judgement, i've decided not to pursue this relationship. we would eventually end up getting feelings for each other which could get messy. also i kind of kind of made out with a different girl who i'm not related to. (i hope.)",3
382_2_3,"this happend back when i was about 9 or 10 give or take.
it was the weekend so the whole family took a day trip to the lake.

we did the normal thing and loaded up on food and snacks to last  us a week instead of a day. we get to the lake and set up, lines are in the water. now all we do is wait. 

as a young kid i didnt know  the virtues of patience. as im sitting waiting for my rod to jerk while eating my cheeto puffs. i see a shit ton of geese (which i confused for sweet 'ol ducks). 

the innocent me thought ""i will feed these nice ducks"". as i get up to go walk over there, my mother instantly knew what i was up to and said  something along the lines of ""dont feed them they'll chase you"". what does she know? i've fed ducks plenty of times. i pretended i didnt hear her and continued on. 


i toss a cheeto into the water and here come the ""ducks"", one eats it right up. i toss a couple more into the water. i didnt want to give all my cheetos so i decided enough was enough. 

this is where the fuck up begins. the moment i stopped feeding these ""ducks"" they all start to come out of the water. i remember this ""oh shit"" feeling. before i knew it i was out numbered. i wasnt letting them take my cheetos. so i decided to run. these ducks start chasing me. the fuckers where determined. my whole family is sitting there laughing while im in some serious shit with a gang of geese. 

i see my grandpa in the distance, i remember running torwards him hoping he would save me (my grandpa was my protector). he had hes back torwards me and went into the porta potty. didnt even see me in distress. 
i see an empty one right near him so i decided to hide in that. 

i run in slam the door shut. i turn around and remember seeing fuckin wasp flying out of the potty. i freak out and run back outside. forgetting about this gang of geese wanting me dead for my cheetos. thank god my mom ended up coming and scaring them all away. 

my family still holds this over me and laugh about it.",2

225_2_2,"let me start by saying that i'm writing this from my friend's perspective, also this happened today. 

i work at a huge waste disposal site, and i have the responsibility for all the hazardous waste that comes in. so today was just a regular day, sorting out all the hazardous waste like paint, oil, batteries etc. when i was done sorting everything out i took myself a well deserved break. 
so i was sitting in my chair casually reading the daily newspaper when suddenly the valve for the emergency fire hose exploded. apparently the water pressure had been on the entire time which ended flooding the entire station. there wasn't much i could do since the only person who knew where the main switch for the water supply was my boss. 

this is where everything went to shit. beneat the emergency fire hose was a huge fuse-box to power the entire station, well all i can is that it broke pretty damn fast. now my boss blamed me for not turning the pressure off which ended in me getting fired. so now i'm at home playing league of legends and listening to bruce springsteen.",3
115_2_1,"a good friends sister moved to our city from another province and he asked me and another mutual buddy to help move her in to her place. we agreed and go down to her place, meet her for the first time, and proceed to move her in. she has an instant attraction to other buddy and they start a relationship. her brother is ok with it because buddy is a good kid and responsible. anyway one thing leads to another and he gets her pregnant and i'm told of the dilemma because they don't know what to do. i tell them it's either they keep it or terminate the pregnancy. they decided abortion is best and book an appointment to get it done. buddy who got her pregnant tells her after the abortion they are done, do she is heartbroken and doesn't know what to do. we, as a group, go out to the bar and she is mangled drunk, and starts texting me suggestive things. i'm half cut at this point and my dick takes over and one thing leads to another and i end up fucking her. i'm scared what will happen if her bro finds out because we are such good friends :(",4
186_1_2,"rooster alarm made for a very, very aggressive cat.",2
221_2_2,"as is the usual on a friday, i leave work and go home for some ""lunch""(we refer to it as fuck me fridays at home).  things we're going well, i walked in the door and said hello to the dogs, then walked over to say hi to my wife.  we walked into the kitchen to set down the food i brought home(i love you jimmy johns!), and well... things escalated quickly. 

we didn't even make it all the way into the kitchen before clothes started coming off.  she had taken my shirt off and pulled my pants down, i didn't even bother taking my shoes off because this was happening then and there--no time for disrobing completely.  at first she was sitting up on the counter bracing herself with her feet against the fridge while i did my best to fuck her right off the counter.  things were going great, except i had yet to notice one of the dogs was standing in the kitchen barking every now and then at us (she was my wife's dog years before we met, and she is very protective).  things escalated and i picked her up and put her on the kitchen table... admit it, so far my lunch is going great, right?

well, that's when shit took a turn downhill.  as many of you know.. a good ol' fucking can sometimes sound pretty damn violent--especially when she is screaming.  i didn't think about it because hey, this is normal for us.. the dog thought differently and apparently assumed i was beating mommy.  after a few moments, the dog began barking more, then more, and then... the growl.  i heard it while it happened, but didn't realize it until it was too late.

all of the sudden i could not just hear the growl, but feel it... then, in a moment my ass wont forget for a while, i feel it.  she barks once, and then bites me full on, right on my left ass cheek.  

i instantly go limp dick, and the lunch fuck is ruined.  we got a good laugh out of it, but didn't get to finish as i had to go back to work by the time we cooled off from the incident.

""this is a really nice gesture,"" i thought. ""maybe he'll know i want things to get better.""

so as i'm typing my message, my co-worker pops her head in and asks me a question. my brain registers a question, and i unconsciously keep typing and hit send. my birthday text read as follows: ""happy birthday dad! love you?"" 

i panic, but it's too late. i send a follow-up text correcting to several exclamation points and apologizing for being distracted because i'm at work. it's been eight hours. he hasn't responded. damn it.",2
