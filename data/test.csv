"so like most of these it happened last year (not today). my family and i were going to florida for a vacation flying out from portland. as our usual family outings go we didn't leave the house until an hour after the planned departure time and were rushing to get things together for the trip. in this rush i forgot my drivers license which was my only form of id beside my passport, which i also forgot. 

we arrived at the airport with 2 hours to spare thankfully, but when it came to tsa checking our ids i didn't have mine. after a discussion with one of the officers they told me they would let me through but i had to answer a bunch of personal questions to make sure i was who i said i was, despite my picture being on my dad's credit card and the fact that i look almost identical to him. 

it took about an hour to get through security and i was able to make the flight. however, i was warned by tsa they can only do this kind of once. this is a problem since i also had to fly back from florida after the vacation. 

we have our fun in florida at universal studios and disneyworld but the time came to go back home. we went to the airport and were met again with the id issue. the officer i talked to was nice enough to let me do the identification again, but told me i was put on a list at homeland security and would be detained if i ever tried to fly without an id again.",3,part3,relationship,tldr

"short fuck-up, not a huge one. it should be noted that i just got out of a 5-year relationship about a month or two ago, so i'm just starting to get back into the whole dating thing. plus, i'm really shit at talking to strangers. social anxiety and whatnot. 

i went to taco bell on my lunch break, ended up going through the drive thru a second time to pick up my co-worker's order. the girl at the window was really cute, and she seemed to be flirting a bit. in hindsight, i'm just really dumb.

anyway, i get back to work, start wondering if i should have suggested grabbing lunch after she gets off work. end up asking a good friend if i should call up there and ask her. he leads with ""that's ballsy as fuck."" but makes the excellent point that i'll never know unless i try. 

being thoroughly convinced, i make the call. ask to talk to her. she gets on the phone, i say something like:

> me: hey! this is going to sound super dumb and i'm not sure you'll remember me, but i pulled through twice about an hour ago?  
> her: yeah, i remember you, what's up?  
> me: i was just wondering, would it be a huge assumption on my part to ask if you wanted to grab lunch after work today?  
> her: that would probably be bad, since i have a kid and i'm in a relationship, but if you want to hang out up here and talk or something that's cool.  
> me: oh, ok, i gotcha. well, i just thought i'd ask.  
> her: yep. well, have a nice day!  
> me: you too!  

cue me feeling lame and depressed. she was super polite and didn't sound creeped out or anything, but i could almost hear the pity in her voice. of course the next thing i do is come back to work and get on reddit to tell internet strangers about it. also, pretty sure i can't go to that taco bell anymore.",1,evaluation,family,tldr

"not today but yesterday, i fucked up by staying home instead of going out to dinner.

a little background. me and my s.o have been seeing each other for the past few months. a large point of contention between us was the fact that we always used her parents car and it would be nice if i had one so we wouldn't always be reliant on her parents goodwill. i say point of contention to denote the on going tirade that is hurled my way whenever we go anywhere and we have to use her car, that basically makes an appearance in the form of a quip or jab 85% of the time we speak.
fast forward to a week ago. i purchased a decent winter car and am spending the bulk of my spare cash on getting it up to spec and insured. because of this we have not gone out in a few weeks. yesterday she called me at work and asked me to take her out for dinner. well more like told me to take her out to dinner. you can probably guess where this is headed.
i refused, saying that is would be better for me to stay in to make sure i could handle the first insurance payment for the vehicle and that we could meet up later that evening for a drink or later that week...

fuck all kinds of duck if that was not the sign from the heavens she was waiting for that i was the basest of scoundrels and cheap bastards to grace the earth. how dare i, after the months of having her drive, have the brazen audacity to suggest staying in yet again. on a tuesday night. to add insult to injury, i later learn that she had argued her mom down for the use of their car and had gotten it to drive just as i was saying i should stay in. 

i know she was hurt that i said no to dinner, and there seemed to be know way to make her understand that i wanted to spend time with her, but i wanted to make sure everything was paid for just as much. unfortunately, aside from some short, angry text messages because she wouldn't pick up the phone last night, we haven't spoken since.",1,evaluation,family,documents

"this actually happened tonight and hopefully won't be removed as being sexual before the weekend, because honestly this is the least sexy thing that's ever happened to me.

one of my least-welcome christmas presents this year was a lovely dose of the cold i picked up from some family member. i've spent the last few days wrapped in a blanket playing pokemon ultra moon and drinking lemsip (which is a powder medicine you mix with hot water to clear the sinuses and just try and feel a little bit more human for a while when you're dying like i am), provided by my wonderful so

so now i'm dealing with the still-present cold, and holding an ice pack to my nethers hoping it doesn't blister.

and as i've just realised, in my haste to get all that shit off me, my 3ds got soaked as well and is now broken.",3,part3,relationship,tldr

"so, to give some context, my family has a large louisiana crayfish boil every year. everyone in the family shows up, and a lot of family friends show up too. there's drinking, catching up with old friends, and a lot of food. but i never ate the crayfish, because the way they squirmed when getting put in the boiling water made me think that they were in pain. one year, i found a few uneaten crayfish at the bottom of the net bag that nobody was thinking of boiling. so, like the good samaritan i am, i decided to give them a bowl filled with water to stay in and took them home with me. eventually, i put them into a river that connected to the columbia by my house. but they turned dark blue in the frigid water, so i thought they were probably going to die. only a few years later (actually today) did i learn that the red swamp crayfish, or the ones that my family used for the yearly boil, had started to multiply and out compete the smaller and less aggressive northwestern crayfish. i know it probably wasn't all me, but now there's a ban on importing crayfish into washington and there's an increasing population of the crayfish we just so happened to use that's harming our normal crayfish population.",2,exploration,work,documents

i've only been driving for a year and a half. ever since i got my license, i've been the taxi for my brother.

so last friday, i had to take him to work. as usual, i had about 5 minutes to get him there due to him dragging his feet getting ready. everything goes smoothly until i get to the turn for the street where his work is. it was a green light but no green arrow. there's a car in front of me, pulled up and waiting to turn, so i pull up behind them. the oncoming traffic stops to let people turn. guy in front of me turns, so i stupidly follow behind and just as i'm nearly around the corner, dude comes up the left hand oncoming lane and thumps me in the left headlight.

yay first accident. now i'm on the hook for maybe over $1000 (find out tomorrow how much the other guy is quoted for fixing his panels. i'm hoping that because he came away with mostly scratches on the front and a couple of slightly popped panels that he put back in place before he left, it'll be cheap.)

"so, in true tifu fashion, this didn't happen today, but rather when i was ten:

so i had just gotten out of the family pool, and i was in the garage drying myself off. it was rather warm in the garage, made even hotter by the 105° f heat. i apparently wasn't warm enough, however, because when i spotted a steel gasoline canister in the corner of our garage, i wanted to see if it would spew flames. 
so, i pick up the canister, find a lighter that was in a toolbox, and turn the can upside-down. i then proceeded to light the lighter to the air displacement hole(having closed the pouring hole), holding the can an inch from my face as i do so.

of course, the can then exploded with enough force to shake the neighbor's houses on both sides of the house.

my mother comes quickly into the garage with a look on her face that clearly states that she was expecting a splattered me on the floor.

wanna know how badly it injured me?
it simply singed my fingers. not burnt, singed. how is my face still intact? no idea. how did i not catch steel shrapnel to various parts of my body? you've got me. 

 the garage was on the far side of the neighbor's​ house who was home. he then came out and asked if a gas can exploded. that's right, he even knew exactly what had exploded. 

i was the luckiest person on the planet at that moment. 

what was i thinking? ""flamey flame whoosh whoosh"", not ""booooooooom"".

in the pool, the only toilets are in the change rooms, and when i need to go i usually go into the family changing room because it is much closer, cleaner and usually there is nobody in it. so my break came up and i went to go do my business when i get to the door i notice it is wide open, i don't hear any noises, and everybody who had come for a swim should have been gone already, so i don't bother yelling into the room just to check. this is where i fucked up. i stroll on in and as i turn the corner after the door, there facing right at me is a 100% buck naked old woman with no nearby towel. she saw me and tried to hide behind one of the benches yelling, as i immediately got out of there as fast as humanly possible saying that i was sorry. the image shall be forever ingrained in my brain. the silhouette of her saggy boobs...  the thought brings back trauma.  who the  fuck leaves a door open and unlocked in a community center.... by definition there are going to be people around. i will never enter a public room again without loudly announcing myself ever again.",3,part3,relationship,tldr

"on the eve of saturday, june the 28th, i was attending my boss's surprise party. on my tranquil walk of merry drink before hand, i had almost finished my first bottle of wine. upon leaving the gallant affair, i was two wine bottles deep, and say, 4-5 beers. all was good; jokes were made, laughs were had, and i arrived home safely. after one more [beer] for good measure, i was asleep in a haze of joyous bliss.

i awoke at the strike of one. however, it was not the clock which disturbed my slumber. unbeknownst to me, my twin had decided to host his brethren to a night of ale and wine. i stirred to the sound of familiar voices, and quickly resumed my perilous, drunken quest. 

as i had passed out on the couch, i woke to a band of muddled men, rambling aimlessly of the current eve's going-ons. i arose to retrieve another beer, but that was when i saw her. the gorgon-witch of nightmares. the ogress incarnate. she who goes bump in the night. 

and that was when my brother took her upstairs.

not long after, my brother returned to our first-floor encampment; a mixture of shame and success painted his face. his tormentor shortly followed suit. for whatever reason, we carried on as usual. drinking games ensued. and, as it turns out, i can be a very mean drunk. 

after having served her numerous cups of ""shut the fuck up"" and, ""how's a face-full of my brother's cum taste?"", i decided it was time to go to bed. i had work in a couple hours, after all. but that was when shit hit the fan. 

for god only knows why, after hours of verbal battery, she followed me to my chambers. i was reluctant at first, but soon my sleep-deprived, alcohol fueled mind took the reins, and anything was a go. yes, before long i was banging this grotesque monstrosity, who's girth i could only just circumvent with my arms, to an oblivion of orgasmic regret. i was also two hours late for work; but hey, fat chicks need love too, right?

"so this happened about a week ago but i still cringe at myself every time i remember what happened. about a week ago i got a whatsapp message from a group of friends which basically went along the lines of this person records his last words before he dies it is really tragic. normally i don't open these kinds of links at work because who wants to feel like crud, but i think nah whatever let me take a peek. so i put my phone on silent with the intent of turning it up as it plays so i can hear it alone. anyway i go to the center of the office sitting in front of everyone and click the link to the ""video"". to my surprise its plays on full blast and is just a woman morning harder harder give it to me harder! everyone drops what they are doing thinking im some sort of perv watching porn at work. i try to explain it to everyone and show them the text but they just laugh at me. the worst part is that there is a really religious girl in my office and she is the only woman there that day so i really cringed harder.",3,exploration,work,tldr
"to picture in your mind because i hate when posts do not clarify if the user who f'd up is a boy or girl, and you have to find out later or there possibly gay, it just totally fucks up the story i place in my mind of these hilarious tifu's. so i am a college aged, young man. i today i fucked up with multiple things. i forgot to set my fucking alarm clock last night so i woke up 50 minutes late for work. literally slab a toothbrush in my work bag and get out the door half naked. turn on my car, to see it was below ""e"", and there is just no way in hell i will make it 25 miles to my shit dung job of telemarketing. i've been a little sick lately so half way there as i merge onto the turnpike i roll down my window to spit out some mucus that has been building up. no i did not make it out the window, in fact for the second time it landed literally directly in my car, a big glob of yellow mucus, that looked like hydrogenated goats piss mixed with dolphins seamen. this is when it happened. i feel rumbling in my belly, still on the highway, and i casually fart, just once. it was such a hot temperatured fart i had to drive while squatting above my seat so the fart could disarray into the air. bad because my a/c shot it right up my nose to shave off all my nose hairs and i probably now have lung cancer because of it. this happened probably ten times before work. it smelt like fucking shit, i'm late for work, fuck. time to annoy random people on the phone, i'm such a smelly bastard  right now.",4,exploration,relationship,tldr

"disclaimer: this actually did happen today.

so i'm currently working abroad, in france, and i'm currently moving all my stuff to paris (i live in a neighbouring city 1h40-1h50 by train). since i'm moving into my new apartment tomorrow, i thought it'd be best to take as much clothes with me on the train and drop them off before going to work. so, i'm walking down an empty street at 6:00am with two huge bags because i'm trying to catch the 6:30 train and when i'm a block away from the metro station i realize my passport wallet was missing. turns out my passport wallet that contained both my passports (i'm a dual citizen) and my discount card, fell out my back pocket due to my bags hitting it.

currently freaking the fuck out because the passport had my visa and work stamp. i could have probably avoided this if i wasn't running to get the 6:30 train.",2,exploration,relationship,tldr
"this happened monday. 

i was about 8 hrs into my 12 hr shift at work. i work in a clean room, so everything in the clean room changing room and the clean room itself has to be spotless to lower the amount of particles in the air. it was my 3rd day and i had been experiencing really bad nausea since day 1 in the clean room. i had to leave the room a couple of times my 1st and 2nd day thinking i was going to vomit but i never did. however, on this day, it was different. i had the sudden wave of nausea come over me and decided that i wasn’t going to run for the trash can outside of the change area because it was always a false alarm. all of a sudden i started gagging and made a run for the change room. i projectile vomited into the sink. my supervisor had to call security to come and sanitize the entire room and nobody could leave for break until the room was sanitary enough to change in. 

an hour later i was working on a machine that pulls the air out of packages and seals it. these machines are very expensive and difficult to fix. i was attempting to seal a package and had to press the reset; what i didn’t know was stepping on the peddle to close the machine and hitting the reset button would completely break one of the most important parts of the machine. the machine opened up and the metal prong that sucks the air out of the package was completely bent upward and the laminate package was melted to the top of the machine. according to my supervisor, i had just made a $500 fuck up. i got to sit in the chair of shame for the rest of my shift because the machine was down and i had nothing to do.",3,exploration,work,tldr

"so my best friend likes my 2nd cousin. i've been trying to get them together for a few weeks now but she just isn't warming up to him so i meet up with her in person. (we live quite closeby in the countryside.) we decided to rendez-vous at the graveyard. we sit down on the edge of a grave because there's nowhere else to sit. i'm trying to persuade her into getting with my friend when she tells me to close my eyes. i comply and badda bing baddo boom we're making out. on somebody's grave. so the grave is covered by one large flag-stone. she pushes me back onto it in the middle of our passionate kissing and the fucking flag cracks down the middle and breaks in two. it's in a v-shape. we both proceeded to run out of there.

gladly we got away with it. 

 

edit: against my libido's better judgement, i've decided not to pursue this relationship. we would eventually end up getting feelings for each other which could get messy. also i kind of kind of made out with a different girl who i'm not related to. (i hope.)",3,evaluation,relationship,documents

"tifu, but nothing really serious, just painful. happened about 2 minutes ago. a little background, i work as a security guard overnight and as long as nobody who isn't supposed to be there is there, i can do whatever i want. to make the time pass, i browse reddit, and the rest of the net, play my gameboy emulator, and other games that aren't as fun. right now, i'm stuck in all of my gameboy games, my luck, so i decided to play the game called 8 ball pool. i don't wanna brag, but i'm kinda awesome. anyway, i always play the tournament, considering you only have to pay $200 to make $1000. i won a few matches, so i felt like my luck was with me. i decided to amp it up and move up a tier, to the next tournament. $3000 for an $18,000 payout? pool gods, i love you. so, i'm actually doing surprisingly well. everyone is well ahead of me in level, but i'm an unstoppable force. awesomeness ensues. i make it to the last match. this guy is pretty good. he makes a very crucial mistake in the game of pool. he didn't set up all of his shots. he runs out in about two or three, and i take over. he doesn't get to shoot again. i finally get to the last shot. i'm gonna fucking do it. i'm gonna win! i set up the previous shot perfectly, so the 8 ball is just chillin' waiting to be dropped into the corner pocket. i take my shot. beautiful. wait. wait. cue ball, where you goin'? nooooooooo! it falls shortly into the side pocket after my wicked sick shot. enraged, i slam my hand down. that's where the second set of balls come in.",2,exploration,work,tldr
