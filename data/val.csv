40_2_1,"so i work at a grocery store as a cashier. i'm 18 years old just to give some context. there's this hot girl that started working on the same day i did (1 month ago). to my knowledge she was single, hot, and definitely looked like she was in the early years of college or taking a year off like i am currently. 

we got talking. a lot. some days we would both be on overstock or be next to each other on cash registers, so there was always an opportunity to talk.

today, she came in to get some groceries at my cash register. with her husband and child. i swear to the universe that she looks like she could pass off as an 18-20 year old.

i think the rule is to not have any relationships with your colleagues but i work a damn temporary job right now so i could care less. i'm glad i didn't tell her that i have feelings for her.",1

57_2_1,"ok, this actually happened a few months ago (valentine's day/friday the 13th) but my friend only recently introduced me to reddit. so there was this really cute in most of my classes and we've become decent friends. so after getting some mixed signals (she put her arms around me one day when walking down the hall) i decide to asks her out. after playing some video games friday afternoon after school, i pick up my phone and text her wondering if she wanted to go to a movie. she responds with a yes, so i brag to everyone in my xbox party that i got a girlfriend. i text a bunch of my friends relaying the good news, one of my friends decides to text her about it. he finds out that she thought i was asking her as a friend and nothing more so he shares it with my best friend who i play xbox with. he then explains to me what she told my other friend. the next day (valentine's day) i get back from a haircut and text her. after she responds i drop the bombshell about asking her out. she kindly responds and says that she doesn't want a boyfriend right now. to make matters worse we had quite a bit in common and now our relationship is severely strained. and this happened one friday night, i'm at my friend's house with all my other friends and when i go to get food, two of my a-hole friends steal my phone and text her saying i love her. they did this twice. i cleared it up but she seems to talk to me even less now. at least she's going somewhere else next year. :(",2

209_2_2,"tifu, reddit, boy did i fuck up.


i have an assignment that was due 9 days ago, but i'm useless so i just handed it in last night.


i'd been awake and working on it for 19 hours. all that was left to do was make a video of what i'd created with commentary on theme etc.


it's about 4am, and i'm recording said commentary, i must've re-done it about 30 times at this point, and stress levels were at an all time high. 


i would note that a lot of people had their last exam yesterday, and as such decided to go out and celebrate... students will be students, right?


i could hear my flat-mates being rowdy, and in my sleep deprived state, i lost my temper and shouted obscenities at them. they shut up... eventually.


ahhhh, the home stretch. i did one more take and nailed it. brilliant. let's get this bad boy submitted so i can get some well-earned sleep!


i woke up today, and decided to relive the hell that's kept me from sleep for so long. within 10 seconds i knew that i'd fucked up, because the wording was different to the commentary i wanted to use... 4 minutes in it hit me like a ton of bricks... 


*""i decided to use a darker theme to make this floo- will you lot shut the fuck up, jesus christ!""*


those words will forever haunt me.


why didn't i check that i'd attached the correct audio file to the video? lack of sleep and complacency go hand in hand, apparently.


well, i'm going to go hide under a rock for, well, eternity.",2
92_2_1,"short fuck-up, not a huge one. it should be noted that i just got out of a 5-year relationship about a month or two ago, so i'm just starting to get back into the whole dating thing. plus, i'm really shit at talking to strangers. social anxiety and whatnot. 

i went to taco bell on my lunch break, ended up going through the drive thru a second time to pick up my co-worker's order. the girl at the window was really cute, and she seemed to be flirting a bit. in hindsight, i'm just really dumb.

anyway, i get back to work, start wondering if i should have suggested grabbing lunch after she gets off work. end up asking a good friend if i should call up there and ask her. he leads with ""that's ballsy as fuck."" but makes the excellent point that i'll never know unless i try. 

being thoroughly convinced, i make the call. ask to talk to her. she gets on the phone, i say something like:

> me: hey! this is going to sound super dumb and i'm not sure you'll remember me, but i pulled through twice about an hour ago?  
> her: yeah, i remember you, what's up?  
> me: i was just wondering, would it be a huge assumption on my part to ask if you wanted to grab lunch after work today?  
> her: that would probably be bad, since i have a kid and i'm in a relationship, but if you want to hang out up here and talk or something that's cool.  
> me: oh, ok, i gotcha. well, i just thought i'd ask.  
> her: yep. well, have a nice day!  
> me: you too!  

cue me feeling lame and depressed. she was super polite and didn't sound creeped out or anything, but i could almost hear the pity in her voice. of course the next thing i do is come back to work and get on reddit to tell internet strangers about it. also, pretty sure i can't go to that taco bell anymore.",1

106_2_1,"this happened about two hours ago and i’m hoping this will help me feel less shit about the situation. throwaway because i’m ashamed.

so bit of background i’m 25,  i work for a landscape company and have a great
relationship with my boss, we hang out on weekends and he’s the best employer iv ever had, couldn’t ask for better. 

so today we had a very hot day, 35 degrees (95 for the americans). instead of our usual duty’s i was tasked with fitting a flatbed truck with a water tank that we’ve had in storage for a while. 

the day was going sweet, i spent all day drilling and fitting the frame, cleaning, painting and generally doing a great job. 

half hour before we’re due to finish up for the day everyone had assembled back at the workshop, including the boss, the last thing to do was to lift the big plastic tank onto the truck using our crane truck, which is basically a big truck with all the things you could ever need to do our work along with an expensive palfinger crane (for those who are interested)

anyway while we’re manoeuvring everything into position i have to lower the tank to re adjust a sling, the controls for the crane are at the side of the truck and we’re lifting directly over the front of the cab, so i’m relying a lot on two other guys to make sure everything’s going to plan. 

all of a sudden as i’m lowering it to the ground i here a crunch and see shards of glass falling on the floor. my heart sank, all the days work fell apart in a second. from great day to potentially $150,000 bill which i take full responsibility for as i was on the controls. 

happy hump day, fingers crossed it’s not a right off. sorry for the bad grammar, i’m two cones down and beers my homey tonight. 

peace and love.",3
265_2_2,"this happened monday. 

i was about 8 hrs into my 12 hr shift at work. i work in a clean room, so everything in the clean room changing room and the clean room itself has to be spotless to lower the amount of particles in the air. it was my 3rd day and i had been experiencing really bad nausea since day 1 in the clean room. i had to leave the room a couple of times my 1st and 2nd day thinking i was going to vomit but i never did. however, on this day, it was different. i had the sudden wave of nausea come over me and decided that i wasn’t going to run for the trash can outside of the change area because it was always a false alarm. all of a sudden i started gagging and made a run for the change room. i projectile vomited into the sink. my supervisor had to call security to come and sanitize the entire room and nobody could leave for break until the room was sanitary enough to change in. 

an hour later i was working on a machine that pulls the air out of packages and seals it. these machines are very expensive and difficult to fix. i was attempting to seal a package and had to press the reset; what i didn’t know was stepping on the peddle to close the machine and hitting the reset button would completely break one of the most important parts of the machine. the machine opened up and the metal prong that sucks the air out of the package was completely bent upward and the laminate package was melted to the top of the machine. according to my supervisor, i had just made a $500 fuck up. i got to sit in the chair of shame for the rest of my shift because the machine was down and i had nothing to do.",3

388_2_3,"greetings! younger reddit browser here to share a story from a day or two ago.

midterms were amongst us, and on this particular day i had my physical education course's exam. the exam was made up of three parts, all under a [pacing program]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5vvroplaw4&feature=youtube_gdata_player): running (linked), push ups, and curl ups. this story revolves around the curl ups.

my friend and i had just returned from doing the push up test, and has decided to get the other ""easy"" test out of the way.  we were part of the last group of people to go up at that time.

after minutes of anticipation, we get set up to start the test.

""we begin in three... two... [beep]""

i lift myself up from the mat, to feel a very distinctive rumble in my nether regions.

*oh, fuck no.*

at a very young age, i thought i had the ability to perform ""automatic farts"" (that's a story for another time; i was one of the weird but kind of cool kids), and would always be quite the entertainment source for friends and family members. until a later age, i never realized i was, in fact, performing queefs. from the years of doing this, i gained quite the exquisite muscle ability in these regions. with such power, it sometimes became abit... uncontrollable.

the muscle contractions from performing these curl ups were causing me to queef.

i was, luckily, saved by the blaring speakers placed right next to my testing mat. but i fear a couple were quite audible- considering the look on one of the coaches faces whilst i was leaving the test area.

i do not have this teacher, but who knows if he'll keep this to himself.

i do not plan on performing curl ups again soon.",2

344_2_3,"this past week i have been helping some good friends of my family move out of their house. very nice respectable people (husband and wife). so the other day the husband (lets call him bob) my two friends and i are helping him pack his garage when he offers for us to smoke some weed with him. being the pothead i am, he didn't have to ask me twice. so he pulls out this funky looking pipe and i jokingly say, that looks like a crack pipe! and we all laugh as he says that he just got some wax. well i have never smoked wax, so he teaches me the way he does it, and i light my hit. i do what he tells me and then i get a very funny taste in my mouth. i instantly say ""wow, that doesn't taste anything like weed i've smoked."" and bob replies ""of course it doesn't."" i look at him with a puzzling look on my face and he says: ""you didn't smoke weed, you just smoked amphetamine. you know meth-amphetamine."" as long as i have known this man i knew he was a pot-smoker, but never knew he was a meth addict. i guess it all makes sense now, because he can rebuild a car or bike engine in one night.

353_2_3,"so i have this disorder where i sleepwalk a lot. recently it's been under control via medication, but the other night i forgot to take my meds. this is where my fuckup happens. 

in my neighborhood everyone is pretty close, and my family is especially close with my next door neighbor. we're always watching their house when they are out on vacation and vice versa. anyways, my neighbor always keeps a key hidden in case we need to get into his house for some reason and we all know where it is. you probably know where i'm going worth this, but to those of you who don't, i ended up walking to my neighbors house, letting myself in with the key and going back to sleep in one of their beds upstairs (they were not home at the time thank god). where the extreme fuckup happens is that they have a security system that will call the cops if a code isn't typed within a certain amount of seconds even if the key is being used. my sleepwalking self didn't think to enter the code so about 20 minutes later i woke up to the yelling and a bright flashlight being shined in my face. i had no fucking clue what was going on in ""my bedroom"". 

after being booked in jail and treated like a robber ""high enough to pass out in someone else's bed"" i finally got out today when the neighbors informed the police that they won't be pressing charges. luckily my parents could prove to them that i have this condition, and even more luckily i wasn't shot by the cops or my neighbor if he would have been home.",2

126_2_1,"ok so this happened when i was in elementary school during recess. sorry if the formatting is bad as i'm on mobile.

so it all started when me and a group of friends were all talking about which girls we liked. this one guy, we'll call him chris, said that he liked this girl called sam. no big deal right? well, this group of three girls who had no relationship with sam that overheard us thought it would be cute to tell sam that chris liked her. so they started running off towards the blacktop (we were at the playground) to tell her. chris starts following them to prevent this. now this is where things get frisky.

me being the bro i am, i start sprinting towards the girls to try and prevent chris's exposure. keep in mind that i am insanely fast. i catch up with them and kick out my feet at one of the girls and trip her and she goes flying and eats shit on the grass. ""haha one down two more to go"" i exclaim. at this point i think the whole thing is really funny until the girl i tripped starts bawling her eyes out and it's just then i realize she has mud and grass stains all over her outfit. oh shit. i quickly dip back to the playground to my friends where they're all laughing at me and i try to think of story to save my ass.

well recess ends and in the next class i get called to the principals office. fuck. our principal asks so what happened during recess? ""well, i was really hungry so i ran toward the blacktop to go inside and i accidentally bumped into jess on my way there"". so why did you say one down two more to go? ""well, i was embarrassed so i just said that"". it took half an hour of my principal to emotionally break me down for me to crack. it ended up in me writing a letter apologizing to jess and a letter to the principal explaining why we shouldn't lie and my parents grounded me for a month so i couldn't go out on mischief night, go ghosting and trick or treating.",4

411_2_3,"this happened yesterday, but the fu is still in place.
first a little background information: two years ago my family and i celebrated christmas in the states (we're from europe). and my dad and i are big fans of disney and have always wanted a glorious tree with bright colors and lights in green, blue, red and yellow, and you can't really get them where i'm from. so of course we had to buy some when we were in the states, and buy some i mean around 200 of them. 

anyways: come yesterday and my brother and i are decorating the tree. we start with the lights (as always), and when we have put them up we realize we need an electrical transformer. no problem, we bought one in the states and i take charge for fixing the right settings. i thought it shouldn't be that difficult and it wasn't. soon enough the tree was brightly shining in 4 different colors. as we continued the decoration of the tree my brother pointed out that the lights were getting a little hot. i thought nothing of it really. until 2 hours later. thats when all the lights one after one died pretty fast and they wouldn't turn on again. turns out in the us you use 110v, but i had plugged it in at 220v burning them all out... so no disney tree this christmas. my mom is happy because she thought the lights were horrible.",3
343_2_3,"i usually use a desktop pc for my redditing, but i also have a little notebook for travelling, which i am currently using because it is christmas and i'm at my mum's.

i was trying to find a comment i made a couple of days ago so i could show a thread to my brother, when i noticed that there was something odd about some of my comments - some of the wording was definitely not what i had typed. obviously this completely wierded me out - i assumed that somehow my notebook had been hacked and someone was fucking with me. it's passworded and there's no way anyone in my family could have used it, so it had to be someone playing silly buggers, right?

so i assumed i must have picked up some kind of keylogger on some dodgy site. i changed all my passwords to everything using my cell phone, which was a right pain in the ass, ran a virus scan, the works.

this evening, i see it happen again, a few words changed here or there. 'what the fuck is going on!' i thought to myself, feeling pretty bloody freaked out. the really freaky thing was that the comments didn't have that little star by them that tells you they've been edited, and every time i changed them they changed back, like someone was waiting for me to notice and messing with me.

i decided to try another browser to see if that shed any light, and the comments were unchanged! then i remembered that, ages ago, i installed the downworthy addon to chrome, which basically changes the clickbait titles of those shitty buzzfeed articles you see on facebook. it had been picking out certain words in my comments and replacing them (not in the actual comment just so that i would see them differently) and so i've wasted a bunch of time and now have a bunch of new passwords to remember. i am an idiot.",3

anyway, this morning i’m drying my hair getting ready for work and mum opens my bedroom door.

“dokkanosaur, do you want this hair brush? i don’t really use it.” i’m still sort of waking up so this caught me off guard. “uh, i guess? i’ll just put it in the bathroom if you don’t want it”, i reply. i thought that was a sweet gesture so i said thanks anyway explained where i’d leave it, just in case mum decided she wanted it back. 

“i’ll just put it here in this drawer, okay?” i suggest. “you can put it anywhere you want to, son.” i’m not really sure what she means by that. “sure, okay. love you mum.” i attempt to hug my mother but she resists a bit.

“is everything okay? don’t you want to hug your son?” i usually play this game with her, she’s a bit of a sulk so i like to brighten things up with a hug every now and then. she turns to me... “i’m just a bit concerned about you, that’s all”. not the response i expected...

“why? what’s wrong?”... 
she responds with “i don’t really have the words now.”

ouch. okay now i’m really confused. i’m running late for work so i can’t really press this issue any further. skip ahead 15 minutes and i’m on the bus when i get a text from my brother:

“hahahahaha mum thinks your gay”

nb: i am straight and very comfortable with my sexuality. i’ve spent most of my adult life in a relationship with one girl or another (23/m/aus, recently single, feel free to hit me up, ladies). if i was gay, i’d have no shame in it and would have plenty of support from friends and family.",1
47_2_1,"when i was born my grandfather bought a brand new 78 chevrolet pickup, it was the only thing new to this statue that i know of in his life. it was his pride and joy, when he passed on, the truck was given to me by my father and aunts as i was so close to him. it was old, beat up, had been wrecked, and i brought it back to running condition, and it has been my ugly truck that everyone made fun of, but they never understood the meaning behind it to me. 

i have always wanted to do a frame off restoration and have it be something that people looked at and thought, ""what a cool truck"". i wanted to see his memory and our relationship last longer. i have spent the past decade trying to figure it out but i am not a super mechanic, nor do i have a shop to do it in, nor the probably 15k or more that it would take. the truck still runs, it needs a lot of work, the body is in much worse shape than it used to be, apparently these things were prone to rusting out. 

somehow life just seems to swallow up some hopes and dreams and this is just one of them for me. don't get me wrong i have an okay life, just depresses me this has never been something i could have achieved. i have went to banks but they do not want to do loans for restorations and the few companies out there that do, want insane interest rates. i will spare all the boring details, i am going to be getting rid of the truck due to it just getting worse and worse with no luck of doing anything to make it better. i am really bummed to see this happen, but i guess it is time, i am grateful for having the time with ""ol'blue"" (trucks nickname) that i have had. so i guessed i fucked up, couldn't plan/appropriate/complete the dream of seeing this memory live on.",1
348_2_3,"ok so this fu actually happened new year's eve. me and my friend went to another friends party, thinking it would be a fun time. well at said party there were only couples sucking face and no music... lame. so me and said friend called up another friend we'll call him ""jimito"" and i feel i should stress how mexican his family is. anyways we head out to his house and ditch lame party. here is where the fu begins. it was pretty dark outside so i couldn't tell which house was his. but, i see this mexican smoking outside and i kinda recognize him. i proceed to knock on the door. this guy laughs a bit and tells me and my friend to head on in. i am pretty good friends with jimito so we head on in. when we arrive inside, there has to be at least 50 people inside. they all stop what they are doing and stare into our souls. i proceed to creep on to ""jimito's room"", but when i open the door all that is inside is workout equipment. now i'm not saying jimito is fat, but... it's obvious this dude does workout... ok he is a little fat. so i realize, this isn't his room. i turn to my friend that was still behind me clueless that this is the wrong house and mutter under my breath ""turn around, this is the wrong house."" so when we get back to the main room everyone is staring at us. no one says a word for 30 seconds(boy was that shit awkward) until i stutter out ""sorry... wrong house"" and we walk out in silence. then the smoking guy outside whips out his cigarette and says to us ""wrong house eh?"". i respond with a stone cold ""ya"" and while we walk to jimito's house all we hear is ""hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha"". 
after that we played smash bros and summoned demons not once mention what happened. great way to end 2015, 11/10 would break and enter again.",2

109_2_1,"so, this is all in all was a build up for over a few weeks.
my best friend is very into cosplay (dressing up like characters for fun and all) and i'm very good friends with her boyfriend as well as his roomate. he and i have been friends since we were 12 (we're now 21). anyway, they both got into a major fight, the biggest fight of their young relationship so far. she felt as if they may break up over it, so she texts me and asked if i could grab a spiked leather collar and leather bracelets, since i was home at the time. so i do and i put them in my car saying that i'll give them back to her. no big deal. well, their fight cools off and we forget about her spiked leather accessories that are tucked neatly away in the center console of my car and go about our busy university lives. and this is where my fuck up begins to build up.
fast forward to this past saturday.
i notice that my check engine light comes on. nothing seems off about my car, so i call my dad the following afternoon and he offers to check it out himself and if he couldn't find anything wrong, we'll take it somewhere to get it looked at. 
in my hurry to get over to my dad's house this morning, i didn't clean out my car as i had originally hoped to do, so i just get over there asap. he couldn't find anything wrong with it up front. so we begin cleaning it out.
lo and behold, the first thing my dad decided to clean out was my center console. and sure enough. bam. there was my friend's accessories. my poor 61 year old father gasps and demands to know if there are any other bdsm toys i'm hiding in my car. of course no amount of explination is enough to get him to believe me. so now my dad believes i'm into some seriously kinky shit.",3

342_2_3,"so, to give some context, my family has a large louisiana crayfish boil every year. everyone in the family shows up, and a lot of family friends show up too. there's drinking, catching up with old friends, and a lot of food. but i never ate the crayfish, because the way they squirmed when getting put in the boiling water made me think that they were in pain. one year, i found a few uneaten crayfish at the bottom of the net bag that nobody was thinking of boiling. so, like the good samaritan i am, i decided to give them a bowl filled with water to stay in and took them home with me. eventually, i put them into a river that connected to the columbia by my house. but they turned dark blue in the frigid water, so i thought they were probably going to die. only a few years later (actually today) did i learn that the red swamp crayfish, or the ones that my family used for the yearly boil, had started to multiply and out compete the smaller and less aggressive northwestern crayfish. i know it probably wasn't all me, but now there's a ban on importing crayfish into washington and there's an increasing population of the crayfish we just so happened to use that's harming our normal crayfish population.",2
250_2_2,"tifu, but nothing really serious, just painful. happened about 2 minutes ago. a little background, i work as a security guard overnight and as long as nobody who isn't supposed to be there is there, i can do whatever i want. to make the time pass, i browse reddit, and the rest of the net, play my gameboy emulator, and other games that aren't as fun. right now, i'm stuck in all of my gameboy games, my luck, so i decided to play the game called 8 ball pool. i don't wanna brag, but i'm kinda awesome. anyway, i always play the tournament, considering you only have to pay $200 to make $1000. i won a few matches, so i felt like my luck was with me. i decided to amp it up and move up a tier, to the next tournament. $3000 for an $18,000 payout? pool gods, i love you. so, i'm actually doing surprisingly well. everyone is well ahead of me in level, but i'm an unstoppable force. awesomeness ensues. i make it to the last match. this guy is pretty good. he makes a very crucial mistake in the game of pool. he didn't set up all of his shots. he runs out in about two or three, and i take over. he doesn't get to shoot again. i finally get to the last shot. i'm gonna fucking do it. i'm gonna win! i set up the previous shot perfectly, so the 8 ball is just chillin' waiting to be dropped into the corner pocket. i take my shot. beautiful. wait. wait. cue ball, where you goin'? nooooooooo! it falls shortly into the side pocket after my wicked sick shot. enraged, i slam my hand down. that's where the second set of balls come in.",2
377_2_3,"this happened around 5 years ago when i was 15.

 my family was on vacation in london and at one point we went to a store that had some military stuff, and i wanted to buy a grenade there with the explosive core taken out. basically it was the metal, heavy outer part of a grenade with a hollow inside. of course i had my dad buy it for me and i took it home cause i thought it was too cool. 

when we were sitting in the airport on our layover back from london in germany, the person at the desk called for me to come to the desk on the speaker. they then proceeded to bring me into a room where multiple soldiers were with guns drawn and ready and my checked bag on the ground in the middle. they asked me to go through it and confused and shaky, i went through the bag. i then realized that the grenade was there and that i was in a potentially terrible situation. i explained to them what it was and they to prove it by pulling the pin. while this confused me because this seemed like a terrible decision on their part, yet there were soldiers with guns out around me, i confidently pulled the pin of the grenade, it didn't explode. now every time i fly my checked bag is subject to ""random searches,"" as they tell me.  the best part is that the grenade wasn't caught in london but actually later in germany.",3
259_2_2,"so, i come into work this morning.
i work at a local hardware store, and i get to my usual moring task of cleaning out our paint tinting machine. 
the machine says two colorants are low: a purple one and a blue one.
i go and refill them. i refill the blue one first. then the purple.
as i was finishing, by chance i looked at the can of colorant that i had just filled the purple tank with.
and at that moment i knew.

i fucked up.

i had just poured the blue colorant into the purple tank, and vice versa. 
i had gone through a training course for tinting paint, and the number one thing they drilled into my head was:
don't mix up colorants, because if you mix them up, it can no longer tint accurately and the whole machine has to be sent out for cleaning and repair.

i go to the back and immediately unplug the machine and urgently call my manager over on the radio.

...when she got there and i explained what happened, i've never seen her cringe like that before in my life. 
...it may be safe to say she might not be my manager for much longer.

 

edit: update. luckily, i have another co-worker that knows how to flush and clean out the machine in the store. apparently this isn't the first time this happened, so he went ahead and cleaned out the machine for me, and my manager has no hard feelings, because accidents happen. 

so i screwed up, learned from it and kept my job. everything turned out better than expected.",4
