"so, basically, i posted a picture of myself on facebook showing my progress in regards to losing weight over the past 5 or 6 months.  it was all thanks to two friends of mine who motivated me to go to the gym and continue to push myself.  without them, i couldn't be any happier than i was before, up until this point.  once i posted my progress on facebook, he came along and asked ""no love for your personal trainer?""  so, i thought i would just joke around with him and thanked him on my picture, which said ""thanks to this guy because i don't know...""  50% to 60% of our conversations have always been joking around, so i thought it was just for fun posting this.  apparently, he didn't think it was a joke and took me seriously.  i updated my post of the picture, showing my true appreciation by thanking him along with some other friends, but he decided to untag himself, which i was confused about.

after i got out of work, i planned to work out with him, because that's what we usually do after both of us got nothing going on for the rest of the day.  when i saw him, he said ""get out of my sight, what you did was bullshit.""  i asked him what's wrong, and it was directed at that facebook post.  i told him i was just joking around, but he said ""just work out on your own.""  feeling displeased, i decided to just leave the gym. 

he basically doesn't want to see me anymore.  a close friend of mine for so long, no longer wanting to see more, all because of some stupid joke i posted on facebook.  i lost the motivation to go to the gym further up to this point and i keep saying to myself it's all my fault.  i promised myself to never make any more senseless or fun jokes, regardless of whoever i'm talking to.",2,exploration,work,tldr

"so i work at a grocery store as a cashier. i'm 18 years old just to give some context. there's this hot girl that started working on the same day i did (1 month ago). to my knowledge she was single, hot, and definitely looked like she was in the early years of college or taking a year off like i am currently. 

we got talking. a lot. some days we would both be on overstock or be next to each other on cash registers, so there was always an opportunity to talk.

today, she came in to get some groceries at my cash register. with her husband and child. i swear to the universe that she looks like she could pass off as an 18-20 year old.

i think the rule is to not have any relationships with your colleagues but i work a damn temporary job right now so i could care less. i'm glad i didn't tell her that i have feelings for her.",1,evaluation,work,tldr
"so i occasionally talk in my sleep, i usually find it pretty funny as i have (apparently) said some pretty hilarious stuff when i'm dreaming(including an amazing, panicked: ""i didn't do it... i didn't do it"" sleeping on a couch up at work once, made several people really worry ),  but this one was takes the cake. this happened last night.

so i fall asleep after my gf stood on my back (/drool i know, having your back stood on is like.. totes cray slammin). after a while i was quite rudely awoken to her on top of me,  smacking my face repeatedly demanding to know ""what's her name hmm?"".  according to her, i had started to cuddle up to her after i fell asleep while she was still watching bob's burger's. most of the time i hate cuddling because i'm like perpetually running hot, and her body heat a would just make me sweat so she was all giddy and excited that i was cuddling her without provocation. apparently shortly after that i started caressing her arm slowly and kind of pressing against her (hehe) and she's like always dtf so i bet she was enjoying that too... until suddenly (read hilariously) i said ""damn girl, i wish you were my girlfriend..."" (capitalization denoting sexy inflection). 

that's when she started slapping me... the ferocity of the sudden onslaught bewildered me at first, dashing any hope of me remembering even the smallest details of the fine dream honey i was probably about to get down with.  at first i tried to say that she can't be getting mad, she doesn't know what i was dreaming about, maybe i was dreaming about her and my dream self had just forgotten about our present relationship because i was dreaming from the perspective of my childhood self. she didn't believe it. 

eventually after i got done laughing stupid hard for a good 10 minutes or so i was just like... well shit, no way to cover this one up... ya i was probably totally just about to dream cheat on you babe, whoops sorry. she was pretty pissed..i think me laughing so hard at it made it better for the first few minutes (she started to laugh for a minute too)... then worse for the last few cuz she's still pretty salty.",2,evaluation,relationship,documents
"okay, so i haven't gone out with friends in a while cause i've been busy with school for the past month or two, so i decided to myself, okay let's take a nice bath and pamper yourself so you feel like the hottest buttslut in the club tonight. i also needed to touch up my hair dye, so a bath works really well to sit around and wait in. 

anyways, because i'm also in a ldr, i really haven't felt the need to impress anyone at all so i've neglected to shave for probably ~6 weeks or so...which has resulted in a nicely fruitful amazon forest. i also just hate shaving and haven't had time.

because of this, i know for a fact the bath water is gonna be full of hair so i grab my cup and use it to rinse the shaver off with. alright, awesome. so i've shaved my legs, armpits, and tacobits and by now you can't even see the water in the cup, it's just a black mass of lady greenery. 

i continue on with the rest of my bath as normal, and then wash my face last. my eyes are closed because of said facial wash and as usual, i reach for my rinsing up. i think you already know where this is going. i thought to myself, oh the cup is already full of water awesome and proceed to dump it on my head.",1,exploration,relationship,tldr

"so this isn't a 1 day fuck up but instead several weeks worth.

i am going to be brief with certain events here because i made a promise to z not to tell anyone what happened and as you will soon understand, it is safer if it just stays hidden. for the same reasons, i have used a thowaway.

a few weeks ago i got a call from a particularly drunken and high z who wanted to do themselves in so i spent that night making sure they were okay. despite some very weird goings on where they were angrily responding to comments that no one had said. due to their unhealthy state.

after that night, everything was perfectly fine until 3 weeks later when this sentence was said ""i will always appreciate you. you are one of the best people i know... i fucking hate you! you are a prick. i hope you die!"" and they ran off. now nothing happened between the two things and i hadn't even had a chance to respond to the first comment.

over the next few days people started learning why she suddenly hated me. when i eventually found out what the story is, i can assure you that it is a very alternative take on what i did that evening. but it does tie in with the ""weird goings on"" i mentioned. now because of the way they have been acting it would appear that they believe this completely so i just tried to ignore everything as much as possible and leave it alone. but after a few too many comments, i said ""i am not going to go into what happened but you can guarantee it didn't happen that way. i don't know why they are saying it, maybe it is because of the alcohol."" i decided not go into the details because i know that that would be better for z. and i am beginning to realise that i can handle this better than they would.

well this got back to z didn't it. now z, along with family and friends is wanting to finish me off for chatting shit.",2,part3,relationship,tldr
"today, i decided that i was going to fix my computer. i'd upgraded straight from windows 7 about a week ago, without doing a clean install, which turned out to be a mistake - i encountered a crap load of driver issues, slow pc, broken programs and all the rest.

 i gave up for the week and went on holiday with my family. i can back today, and told myself that i would just reinstall windows cleanly. i'd wipe my drives and start from scratch, just so nothing could go wrong.

as it turns out, when i started the re-installer, my mouse or keyboard wouldn't work, so i had to boot from a usb, which took an hour to find the right size.

finally, i'd found one, installed the installer and set everything up. it was going well, the install went really quickly, and i finally was relieved to have a functioning windows 10.

#turns out i accidentally installed the 32 bit operating system.

bloody. livid.

i realised this when my computer could only use 4gb of the 8gb of ram i had, and i was suspicious when the initial screen resolution was 720p, but i thought it was just how things were - none of my programs were recognised my my computer, even though they were physically there, which i'm guessing(/hoping) is the issue of it.

anyways, here in after 4 hours of uninstalling and backing up and reinstalling all sorts of shit, only to find that i have to do it all again.

"so today we decided to fix up the paint job on a couple of walls on our hallway. no big deal, right? we certainly thought so.

i got the paint, a roller, cleared everything out of the way and got to work. 5 minutes into the job i notice something funny. the paint seems to be peeling off of the wall and on to the roller. i start peeling the coat of paint off of the wall but more and more starts coming off.

as it turns out, there were too many coats of paint on the wall and the one i added made an older layer peel off.

so now here i am, peeling the paint off of the wall with my hand, hoping it will stop peeling off somewhere so i can get on with the paint job. nope! 2 hours and a lot of frustration later i ended up peeling off all of the paint i had put on, as well as parts of the underlying layer.

in the end i just gave up. instead of 30 minutes of touching up the paint job i'll end up pulling down all the wallpaper and starting from scratch. it'll probably end up costing hundreds of euros too.

"this was a few months ago now but can't resist sharing this now i've found somewhere suitable.

at the time, i was in the final year of my undergrad maths degree and i had my girlfriend round to have a night off from studying and watch a film. we started to get a bit frisky then i realised i didn't have any condoms in my room, so i went to go and get one from one of my flatmates. on the way back, i spotted i'd left one of my maths books open on the coffee table in the living room. i suddenly had a brainwave about one of the problems on the page it was left open on, so couldn't help but get to work, temporarily forgetting about my horny girlfriend sitting naked in my room.

about 30 minutes later, i started to hear screaming and crying from my room, so i rushed back. my girlfriend was very angry and accused me of always choosing maths over her and gave me an ultimatum of either i start paying more attention to her or she leaves me. i told her that i can't help being enthusiastic about my subject and she will have to deal with it - she then put her clothes on, walked out and slammed the door. i decided to sleep on it before deciding what to do, but when i tried to contact her via facebook in the morning i discovered her relationship status was ""single"" and that she had de-friended me.",3,evaluation,family,tldr

"like most fu this didn't happen today but on my birthday several years back which i celebrate with each side of my family cause my parents are divorced.

so before the birthday dinner i went to play with my niece who was about 7 and at some point she goes on to show me her new bed which she had just gotten the week before. now here's where it all started..she went on to ask me if i too had a bed and being the sarcastic bitch that i am i replied with ""no i sleep on a magic flying carpet""....now what i didn't know is that she had never seen aladdin before so she didn't know about his magic carpet and since children don't understand the concept of sarcasm she actually thought i slept on a carpet instead of a normal bed
a few moments later when the family dinner is a about to start i hear disturbing mumbling in the next room but didn't really think of it until i came home and my mom was in complete distress about a phone call from my father wanting to file a lawsuit against my mom........apparently my niece told my half-brother that ""auntie doesn't have a bed, she says she sleeps on a carpet"", he then told my father about it and my dad was so outraged thinking that his ex-wife (for some completely ridiculous reason) lets her daughter sleep on a carpet on the floor and wanted to have full custody over me that's why he called and told her he was gonna go to court about this

needless to say i had to go over to my brothers flat the next day and clear up the misunderstandings and in the end my mom was never sued for my stupid mistake

"so i will be honest, this happened a few years ago while i was in my english class in college. my professor was a nice enough person, but she was highly liberal with her thoughts. she often tried to get the class discussing/argue different events based on her opinions. my personal favorite was the time she brought up rihanna straddling a pink cannon was a way of empowering women. i had a field day with that one.

anyway so she ends up assigning us an extra paper that was not on the syllabus. i am annoyed because i already have a ton of work for my computer classes, next thing i need is a 7 page persuasive paper to write. so i am annoyed and decide to write on something most people disagree with. polygamy. yes polygamy, not to be confused with polyandry or polyamorous relationships. i wanted to only discuss the single side that men should be able to marry as many women as they choose.

so i already know i am gonna annoy her with my paper. i researched and did a lot of work on it. i needed a quote though. so i decided to look for the most outlandish person i could think of...hitler. by gods i found it! i found a quote from hitler saying approves german soldiers to take as many women as they like.

so i am trolling hard with this paper, i know i am gonna annoy some people just from how one sided this paper is. well i get into class that day. only to find out instead of her doing all the work...the paper will be peer review. my paper got a lot of hate...but i still got a b+. it wasn't until 3 days later i remembered she was jewish too.",4,evaluation,family,tldr
"this happened 3 days ago.
a little background story: i met this girl online and dated her for 2-3 weeks before breaking up. never met her, still haven’t and don’t plan on doing so and all my friends know about this. 

 i was having spanish class and she being the cool teacher she is, she decides to stop class 20-30 minutes earlier and asks about our lives. she goes around the class and asks us questions. 

my turn, great. ""mr. /u/barra420, do you have a girlfriend?"" i answer, ""i used to"" she then asks what happened. (i met this girl online and started dating her without ever meeting her, yeah i know, what the fuck) i proceed to tell her the story of how i met her and she goes batshit crazy. “so you mean you dated this girl that for all you know could be a man? how do you know she wasn’t a pedo or something like that? should i talk to the school counselor?” all those types of questions.

i start explaining myself, every single guy in the class by now is laughing their brains off. the girls look at me like i just shit on the bible and waved a confederate flag in front of a black priest. 
after my explanation she decides to change topic and asks what i do on my free time. i answered that i really enjoyed watching movies and spending time on the computer. she then says “i see, so you enjoy watching porn” every single person in the classroom bursts in laughter. 
guess you can say i have a long year forward with her bringing my online girlfriend up all the time.

so to start i have three best friends. not going to name names but we have been friends through previous family connections for years. my mates birthday was friday and we bought alcohol as we have done for the rest of our birthdays this year. (we all turned the legal drinking age this year.) once we we're sufficiently stocked we headed back home to reminisce about stories of the past. a few hours and half a litre of alcohol later is where i can no longer tell the story from my point of view. according to my friends i collapsed. being inebriated they panick and load me into their car. they drove down the road open the door and push me out infront of a house. as i lay on the lawn the owners of the home noticed i was lying in their yard. not sure if i was alive or dead they called 911 immediately. i was then rushed to hospital and immediately put on a ventelator. the hanting detail is at 2 am my mom had text me asking when im coming home. two minutes before i was thought to be in a coma by hospital staff. i cant say what else happened until the time i woke up at 5:36 am. later my mother told me i was 1-2 drinks away from slipping into a coma as my bac was a 0.36. the reason i posted this was to warn people to drink responsibility. i didnt even feel too drunk during this time. remember how precious life is.

it failed to rekindle her interest though.  she said nothing about either of my examples.   she asked no follow up questions at all.  

""do you have any questions for me?"" she asked tersely.  when all was said and done, the interview ended 10 minutes early.

i looked around and did not see any other christmas wreaths, but seeing as i just moved in, i figured my lovely apartment building must have given me a holiday gift. note: they also gave me a goody bag upon move-in in october, and the security staff all love me. clearly i'm worthy of a free christmas wreath!

fast forward to a week later--a sunday. i heard a lot of knocking and chatter on doors throughout the evening with much confusion and wondered what was up. then i heard talking outside my door. ""maybe we should just leave a note and ask.""

knock knock knock

i answer. a neighbor and her boyfriend were there. i had met several times prior (they actually gave me a free sam adams mug once, i believe. they won it at an event and the bf didn't want to bring it back to baltimore.

i toss a cheeto into the water and here come the ""ducks"", one eats it right up. i toss a couple more into the water. i didnt want to give all my cheetos so i decided enough was enough.

on this particular day i was set to task to make a blue dyeing reagent meant to be used in a production run for a stool sample testing kit.  since it was for production and not just lab use it was very important that it be made correctly. this was stressed to me repeatedly. ""this needs to be by the book!""

so instead of just processing off the order sheet i pulled our department reagent book to get the official formulation and created the item from that.  now is where the fu comes into play.  whoever it is that put in the order had at some point changed the formulation and we had an old copy of it in our book.  the book showed the weights listed in mg or milligrams, but the order had it in mcg or micrograms.  so i proceed and process the order by the book!

reagent goes off to production and is ran and made into testing kits.  the next day quality assurances pulls a few kits to test and they fail.  horribly.  why? well there was 1000x more blue dye than the order called for.  

i get pulled into a meeting where i get dressed down about this fu that's costing the company thousands to fix.  i am beside myself with guilt and apologize.  when i notice the discrepancy i bring it up to the person who ordered the reagent, she takes it to my boss's direct supervisor who then dresses down my boss for the fu of not updating the formulation book for 3 years.  i then get treated like a moron for the remaining 6 months i worked there.",3,exploration,work,tldr
"little bit of background: winter 2013 college semester i started to fall for this girl that i meet through a mutual friend. fast forward to a week after school gets out, she goes home for the summer and i start working third shift, gotta make the money, so she breaks up with me. a week later she starts going out with her friend from back home who she ""wanted to go out before but didn't want to get into a ld relationship, but its cool now because this year he will be going to a local community college that is near the college we go to.""

ok, now back to today, yesterday ex-gf wants to hang out for a bit as we are going to try to just be friends as there wasn't much relationship before we broke up. so i hang out with her and the old feelings resurface in me, time to gtfo and have some whiskey. 

so today i went to football tailgating at the college i go to, hot greek little sister walks up with her friend ""hey bigwag91, this is my friend hotgurl, blah blah blah, she just got out of a two year relationship. she is just looking to hang out. had i not been thinking about last night (or maybe the hangover of today) i would have seen this as a total green light on hotgurl. later hotgurl is talking to me alot giving little hints that i should have noticed but i couldn't muster myself together enough to take these hints and lay some moves on hotgurl.

later on i ended up having to go up to here and apologize for acting like a complete idiot in front of her and we got to talking. ex lovers, friends, interests, etc, etc. the ex lovers part was the worst cause after talking for 45-60 minutes she looks and me and goes ""you will find someone, don't worry"" but gives major hints that i missed my chance. 

 

p.s. ""today"" is actually yesterday

"to start the story i have to go back about a week. i got new box springs for my hand-me-down king size bed from the nebraska furniture warehouse. they tied the two twin box springs down after we waited an hour with rope and so we set on home. to make it fit in my room better i decided to clean, paint, and get rid of a giant desk. i took the desk apart and threw it in the back of the pickup. got the bed, slept great whatever. today about four days later i decided to go to the weight room. i grabbed the keys and set to the truck. when i was younger we weren't on top of the whole driving thing so here i am 17 and only have a permit deciding to drive. i get to the weight room and as soon as i pull into the parking spot i back up to readjust myself and hear a clank sound. i'm thinking the wood fell out; i go out to put it back in. there isn't any wood on the ground instead the exhaust pipe fell. i get one of my friends in the weight room and he says just make sure it isn't hitting the tire.  i call two other friends just to see if they could help. we look under there and the clamp that holds the tailpipe is twisted. so shit it's not fixable by me. my friend calls his more truck savvy dad but he is at work. so using rope that's still in the truck we kinda rig it up. i get it home and like a pussy i go to my friends house not worrying about it. at dq my brother gets a call. we go home, i lie then confess because i was fucked. i get grounded for 2 weeks and lose all trust. my brother is absolved of it because he did nothing but lie for me. apparently there was rope in the drive way and some wedged under the tool box in the bed. what happened was the rope from the week before got twisted the clamp some how and popped the exhaust pipe out. it's part bad luck part me just being a retard and not walking.",3,exploration,work,tldr
"this happened a few weeks ago, and i just remembered to post it. 

so, i'm in my high schools jazz band and every year we preform at an arts festival at a town near us. in our band, we have one couple who are pretty open about their relationship. 
after out performance, we were all hanging out outside eating street vendor food and talking or whatever, while the couple is eating each others faces out. our band director is no where to be seen, so me and two of my friends decide to screw with the couple. 
this is where we fucked up. to get the couple to stop eating their faces out, we got some pennies and threw them at them, lightly. we had no intentions to hurt them. 
supposedly, the girl in the couple thought we were calling her a prostitute by throwing pennies at her, so the next day we get called into our assistant principals office. we get a lecture on how not to be sexual predators, and how if this happened in a workplace we'd all be fired and labeled as predators. we all also got a detention.",3,evaluation,relationship,documents
"as the title says, i fucked up using fb, but there's a little more to it than that.



so, from time to time, i dig through my friends facebook friends list, which leads me to another person, and so on, until i get to a person that i want to.....facebook stalk. just a little....not often at all. 

it is my ex's now husband i look at....just to, i don't know, torture myself, or to see if their life is good or not. (it is, but so is everyone's on fb i guess)


being older i should know better than to do this childish shit, but i get bored sometimes, maybe a little sad, perhaps hungry, possibly a bit drunk, and i start digging.

well, lo and behold  i took a trip down memory lane, through sadville boulevard, and ended up in terrorville, as i discovered that the button next to his name was not blue with the normal words, ""send request"", but it was white with, ""request sent"" next to it.


literally a feeling of shock and horror overcame me. her and i did not have a pleasant ending to our relationship (my fault mostly), and i highly doubt the request was looked upon in a pleasant light. i now feel like a jackass.....a total jackass. i do not remember the last time i looked him up, but either way i'm sure he saw i sent that request. 


i ended up taking the request back, as well as blocking him. i did this for 2 reasons.....a: hopefully it gives the impression that i did not mean to send that, and i am no threat, and b: i don't ever want to see that page on the interwebs ever again.",2,evaluation,work,tldr
"yesterday morning i was multitasking,

i put milk on the stove and then went 
to the bathroom to shave, which in itself is not a good idea.

while sitting on the toilet i was listening to my ipod classic and began
to put on a landing strip. approching take off i cut myself and propelled my ipod into the bowl, panicking i get up knocking my head against the mirror door.

so by this time i'm lying on the floor bleeding at multiple spots and confused as hell. after realizing what has happend i plan on getting my ipod and turning it off. easier said than done, grabbing it out of the bowl i notice that i got no idea how to accomplish this trivial seeming task.

sprinting to my laptop and getting blood everywhere i hold play on my ipod. nothing happens. i figure out that i have to hold play and center, wait for it to boot up fully(which is an eternity for apple products) and then turn it off. after 2 minutes or so i finally succeed. 

remember the milk from the beginning? well me neither. but my alarm did and comes screaming at me while i'm disinfecting nearly giving me a heart attack.

you'll probably like to know if the ipod is working.
it does, but it displays a firewire not plugged in message from time to time (which makes sense i guess, since firewire isn't plugged in)

"so after my workout i made my usual protein shake. i went to my computer while i was shaking it, trying to remove all the chunks. well, i thought it was all good to go so i took a drink. nope, still chunks. so i set it down and finished typing whatever i was on the computer.

i picked it back up to give it another good shake to remove chunks. as i start shaking it fiercely, liquid just starts flying everywhere, all over me, my keyboard, my bed, floor, everything... 

now my keyboard doesnt work, my bed and floor has a weird smell, and my desk is sticky. turns out protein shake doesnt come out of things very well..",2,exploration,relationship,tldr

"this happened yesterday. i wanted to download youtube videos, extract the audio, tag it properly and save it. so i wrote a stupid bash script using youtube-dl and ffmpeg and some dirty hacks, which was no way a foolproof one and required a temp folder. being overly obsessive with clean directories, i included a **rm -rf *  ** in the end to clean the temp. it was working like a charm on one of the desktops, so i thought, ""hey, let me run it on my laptop."" so far so good, but i forgot to create necessary temp folder and ran it anyway. since there was no folder to act upon it went on running in my home itself, removed my downloads, documents and music. now i am scared to reboot, fearing that i won't be able to log in.",3,evaluation,family,documents
"it’s my birthday today. happy birthday to me!
my day started well, favorite breakfast, lunch at the street corner on my work, and dinner with friends and family. now as i lay in my bed, my phone beeps for an alarm for my birthday with a letter attachment to it. i wrote myself a letter last year of the things i should do, adventures i should take, lessons i need to learn etc. as i go through the letter i can’t help but notice that i almost accomplished all of those things on the letter.  except for my biggest fu.

i told myself to stop dating different girl every month and just focus on one. and i did. i met her, and with her i am me, no holding back, no lies, not pretending, i am just me. last year was an amazing year because i have her. then i fu. i broke up with her because i got cold feet and i thought we were going too fast and we are going serious too soon. 

now that it is my birthday, i never felt alone. yes, i have my family but i have an estranged relationship with all of them. i have my friends who i met through games but i they never understand the real me. i had her, nothing else matter except her but i lost her because my 25 year old me broke up with her one sunny wednesday thinking it is the right thing to do. of course the player in me, ignore all her calls, and texts, and never answer the door to even just talk. 

if i could go back to fall of last year, i would kick myself in the balls, or i would even touch habanero peppers then remove my contacts and wank without even washing my hands to learn my lesson. 

i never felt so alone, so on my birthday, i hope you guys learn from my lesson. it’s ok to be afraid, to get scared, to feel overwhelmed, because of the end of the day, you have that someone and the feeling being loved is the greatest feeling of all. (plus, you don’t want to ever experience the habanero situation!)",3,exploration,work,documents

"so, i come into work this morning.
i work at a local hardware store, and i get to my usual moring task of cleaning out our paint tinting machine. 
the machine says two colorants are low: a purple one and a blue one.
i go and refill them. i refill the blue one first. then the purple.
as i was finishing, by chance i looked at the can of colorant that i had just filled the purple tank with.
and at that moment i knew.

i fucked up.

i had just poured the blue colorant into the purple tank, and vice versa. 
i had gone through a training course for tinting paint, and the number one thing they drilled into my head was:
don't mix up colorants, because if you mix them up, it can no longer tint accurately and the whole machine has to be sent out for cleaning and repair.

i go to the back and immediately unplug the machine and urgently call my manager over on the radio.

...when she got there and i explained what happened, i've never seen her cringe like that before in my life. 
...it may be safe to say she might not be my manager for much longer.

 

edit: update. luckily, i have another co-worker that knows how to flush and clean out the machine in the store. apparently this isn't the first time this happened, so he went ahead and cleaned out the machine for me, and my manager has no hard feelings, because accidents happen. 

so i screwed up, learned from it and kept my job. everything turned out better than expected.",4,exploration,work,tldr
"so  was a few months ago, but oh well.

at the time i had recently got a girlfriend, lets call her jess. she's 18 and i'm 20. both of us were virgins, so we started messing around pretty quickly into the relationship. 

at first we used bare skin condoms with no problems at all. my best friend, lets say andy, was stoked i lost my virginity finally that he agreed to surprise me with a box of his favorite condoms. 
""free condoms, can't go wrong there!"" i though with enthusiasm. well it went wrong there

the next day, jess and i decide to try the new ones. we start doing our this, wam bam thank ya mam, sexy time complete. the day after she notices when she goes to the bathroom, it hurts. since she still lives with her parents she tells them about the bathroom issue.

so her mom brings her to the doctor, jess tells her doctor (with her mom in the room) that she had sexual intercourse the day before. turns out the lube on the condoms caused the infection. the worst part is that her parents now know i deflowered their daughter within a month of dating her.

"so this happened yesterday.

so i have to give you guys some background, my family is not rich, we have are struggles but sometimes we don't it's complicated, my dad bought me these raybans that i had been asking for and they were around $300. now i have never spent $300 in anything just like that usually we finance so i was pretty surprised when my dad did that. now back to the story, yesterday i was having a pretty bad day because i did not have anything to wear to a party because all the clothes that i had were not formal. so i was sad as shit sitting in the bathroom taking a shit and i put my glasses on the ground. now i'm mostly blind without my glasses and prior to sitting in the bathroom i told my sister if she could iron my shirt and she agreed so i was sitting their shirtless and blind when my sister knocked on the door to tell me she was done ironing. i got up and fucking stepped on these expensive ass pieces of shit right in front of me and then i dropped water all over the bathroom. now i am sitting here fixing my glasses that have cracks and too scared to tell anyone because my dad spent so much money on them.",3,part3,relationship,tldr
