,7,evaluation,relationship,tldr,using an expired condom,119,143,0.7799999714,119,"this happened in the middle of november, i'm a 17 year old guy that got a job at a fast food joint back in may. at night there is only 2 people on shift so depending on who im working with the conversation  between us could be innocent or not. the female i enjoy the company of most would be my 28 year old chubby dark haired pale skinned co worker, we will call her ""big butt"" or ""bb"".  bb loved how i flirted with her, and after only a few weeks we were having **** on a regular basis. we kept our physical relationship secret from our coworkers so as to avoid unnecessary gossip.

  at some point in november is when the **** happened, after work one night me and bb ride back to her place, get intimate, and then realize i cant find any condoms. normally i have a box with me but on that specific night i had misplaced it and the passion was already getting thick. i said i would just pull out of her but bb insisted she had condoms laying around. out from the bottom drawer of her bathroom sink she pulls out a couple dusty lifestyle rubbers that look like they have been there for years. 

  fast forward about 30 minutes and i'm pulling myself out of her **** noticing how the condom completely tore in half and now my **** is gushing out of her **** as well. 

4 weeks later and her period never came, and another 2 weeks after that bb learned from her doctor she is pregnant. i still have not told my parents about this nor do i know how to tell them.



 


edit: so im dumb because some simple plan b would have prevented this, oh well too late for that then. off work finally! time to go pay bb a visit;)","got a summer job, met a sexy plump women with a ferocious sexual appetite, forgot the new condoms one night and used an old dusty one instead. baby is on the way.",,,,,,,,,,7,Tamir,"got a summer job, met a sexy plump women with a ferocious sexual appetite, forgot the new condoms one night and used an old dusty one instead. baby is on the way.",4.

so this evening, yes this very one, i was offered **** in a curious fashion. i am married, and i have never really been put in a situation like this. the lady that offered was a close friend of mine. she has an amazing personality and i didn't even realize what she was doing. she and i were talking about her most recent relationship and she went into a conversation about desiring a fwb. what i didn't realize is that she was referring to me. as a married man, i have never had this problem, or had someone even approach the topic like that. i drove home only to receive a txt stating that her offer was obviously declined. apparently my ""i need to get fucked"" radar has stopped working. or perhaps what little morals i have left are finally playing a role in my life.","friend wanted a fwb relationship with me, a married man in a sexually lacking marriage. walked away and was told of my mistake immediately.",,,,,,,,,,14,Tamir,"friend wanted a fwb relationship with me, a married man in a sexually lacking marriage. walked away and was told of my mistake immediately.",1.

,27,evaluation,relationship,tldr,blowing a ripped dick (nsfw),50,32,0.7300000191,50,"this happened last (saturday) night.

my bf was sleeping over as per usual, but this night we ended up having a long serious conversation about our relationship. after things cooled down, we started getting frisky and one thing lead to another...

the **** hadn't worked out as expected because he started feeling sharp pains, so i wanted to finish it off with a quick handy/head. i told him to start it by whacking himself off. everything we did was in the dark, so when i felt splatters of liquid i assumed it to be his precum and ignored it. when he got close i started going at it, and i completely dismissed the fact that it tasted a little odd..
after we finished up and went  to wash up, the light revealed smears of blood all over our bodies and spots of blood on the bed. at first we thought it might have been from me, but upon further inspection we realized he'd torn his **** (frenulum) and his **** was actually blood. needless to say, he went into total shock and we spent a good chunk of our morning at the clinic.

,29,evaluation,relationship,tldr,going on social media today,1,3,0.6700000167,1,"this happened today immediately before posting this, my first thought was to tell me fellow redittors about my ****.

the story starts with me dating this girl for about a year. we met during a work conference and have tons of common coworkers, but we had to keep everything on the dl since we work together. everything was great and i began to fall for her, even as we have discussed to keep it simple. we even ended up going to weddings out of state together and spent weekends with parents, whatever. 

shortly after she had moved away for work, i broke it off. i was seriously in love with this girl where she was, for the lack of a better term, eh, about it. there would be lapse in communication for weeks at a time despite my effort to reach out to her. she just wasn't allocating any capacity emotionally to take it all seriously. devastated, but life goes on.

throughout our relationship there is always guys who are super into her, i mean, reasonably so, she's a beautiful, amazing human being, inside and out. and there's always one guy that i know is totally in love with her and you all know the feeling, something is afoot. not that i didn't trust her, but his motives are 95% of the time questionable. 

fast forward to today, i passed my fundamentals of engineering exam and was super excited to tell my friends on facebook. a picture of them together in a black 'n' white, adorable, super wide smile fashion sits on the center of my screen. my face freezes, my hand shook, and my fragile heart breaks into a thousand pieces all over again.

 

p.s. this is my first post on reddit, and here's a gif of me diving into a pool of feels.

,31,evaluation,relationship,tldr,pantsing my father in front of my family at a party...,141,25,0.8899999857,141,"now this happened when i was at the mere age of 14. 

i was going through this stage where i wanted to prank everyone and everything. i have no earthly idea why. 

now, to start off with this story, let me tell you about my father and i's relationship. my father and i never really bunted heads with each other, and we would always make each other laugh. it's been ages since i made him disgruntled in the slightest. so naturally i had my guard down on this certain weekend. 

it was a weekend night, and my extended family came over for a party (i don't remember why). everyone was having a good time and my dad came home from work, greeted everyone, and then immediately changed into his weekend clothes which consisted of pajama pants and a t-shirt. i myself was having fun. but being my idiotic fourteen year old self, i noticed my dad's ""loose"" pajama pants and decided i had to get a load of it. 

""it is perfect,"" i thought to myself. so i snuck up to my father, grabbed his pants by his waists, and slid them off faster than ever. i smiled and laughed, expected everyone else including my father to join in, but after 2 seconds i saw my dad's red face when he went and pulled his pants back up. everyone was quiet. i look over him and noticed my 6 year old sister was right in front of my dad when i ""pantsed"" him. she probably saw the bulge up close.  

my dad didn't say anything, but i could see that he didn't want to talk at all. he went in his room and didn't come out for the rest of the night. 

i was terrified for the punishment. i was never in trouble and the anticipation was murderous. i just pulled my dads pants in front of 7+ family and especially my little sister. 

but alas, my dad came down to my room when everyone was gone, and told me not to do that ever again and just walked away after that. it still haunts me to this day, and i bet my father feels the same.","family had a party, and my teenage mind decided to pull my dad's pants down in front of everyone and my little sister. regret it ever since.**",,,,,,,,,,31,Tamir,"family had a party, and my teenage mind decided to pull my dad's pants down in front of everyone and my little sister. regret it ever since.**",2.

(i'm a big piano player and i enjoy it a ton). so i go on with life after this, go to the supermarket and get popsicles for everyone at the branch, quickly forgetting about the big mistake we unknowingly made. we get back to the branch, and james' girlfriend who we'll call juno gets ultra mad, and breaks up with him. so at this point i'm feeling pretty **** for ending their relationship singlehandedly. right after this, my mom comes rushing into the work panicking and asking if i'm okay. it turns out one of the people in the group chat, who we'll call brennen told his mom, (a hand therapist) who immediately turned around from their vacation and started heading home while sending panicky ""sorry about duncan"" (my theoretical name) texts to my mom. lastly three of my friends left their jobs to head to the hospital where i wasn't actually there.","tried to make a joke, ending up ending my best friends relationship, ruining another friends vacation, and getting three of my other friends to leave their jobs.",,,,,,,,,,33,Tamir,"tried to make a joke, ending up ending my best friends relationship, ruining another friends vacation, and getting three of my other friends to leave their jobs.",3.

my uncle is a seriously great guy and was a huge role model for me growing up. i really felt like i hadn't ever told him that growing up and decided to write him a letter saying what he means to me and thanking him for being a big part of my life.  

another concept that stuck out to me was exposing your vulnerabilities to other people and i thought that was great. it's exhilarating. when you open up to a stranger and tell them a little something about your life. then i had the greatest idea. i could share my letter to my uncle with a few girls i was currently talking to. this is where it goes downhill. i told myself next time i see them in person, i'll challenge myself to open up more and share the contents of a really personal letter. i now realize this was a flawed idea looking at it from any angle. the first being that it's creepy. i've met these girls a handful of times and i asked them to read something like deep. its not even like i shared it with them in a genuine way. literally like heres how i view myself and my relationship with my uncle and read it. but it gets worse. for whatever reason, i describe the concept of my letter as a little book with my thoughts and i opened up in there and i wanted them to read it. so they literally just asked if it was diary and it seemed like one so i just agreed. i now realize i asked these girls i barely know to just read my diary.",self help books told me to ask girls to read my diary.,,,,,,,,,,45,Tamir,self help books told me to ask girls to read my diary.,3.

i had 1500 saved up finally and we both planned for me to be there 2 months from now. i was getting things in order and yesterday i came home to find my window was broke and someone had broken in. i had the money hidden well and my mess up was not having it in a bank account somewhere. unfortunately i know who did it but can't prove it. so now i am sitting here absolutely broken.

i don't know what to tell my girlfriend. i feel lost now. my plan is shattered and because i was incredibly ****. i am going to talk to her on friday. i'm just not sure what i am going to say. she was depending on me to be there with her and start a life together. a life we have been waiting so long on. i have a feeling this will tear us apart. i don't want it to.

this was my biggest mess up ever. the best advice i can give to anyone is do not store alot of money at your house for any reason. just don't. put it in a banking account because if not, you may find one day the same thing i have and it may ruin your life. they have an investigator coming out but my gut feeling is that he won't be able to do anything about it.

all i have done since i found out is call the police and make a report. other than that, i have sat on my bed and mostly crying as i message her and pretending to be okay. she is wondering why i won't skype with her. just telling her i don't feel good. please someone learn from this story and don't do what i did. i feel incredibly **** and i essentially ruined my life.",version - didn't put money in the bank and it got stolen. now i messed up my relationship and life i fear.,,,,,,,,,,49,Tamir,version - didn't put money in the bank and it got stolen. now i messed up my relationship and life i fear.,4.

that's where i should have stopped but i didn't. instead i kept messaging her and asking if she was down to hang out. she agreed to watch a movie with me. i didn't find it romantic at all but we did talk a bit after getting out of the theater and plus we ate together. we shook hands and parted ways.



then she told me she needs her laptop fixed and so i went to her place, fixed it and she told me she'd repay me. we went out for coffee and then we went back to my place. i showed her around and she enjoyed hearing me play the guitar. 


she texted me the following days about how the guitar was something she didn't expect to see from me. we messaged a little more after that.


so here we are. the weekend of november 15-16. she came over saturday night with alcohol. i knew what was going to happen but i felt like a **** for not stopping myself. she got tipsy and i got tipsy as well. i played her a song and she kissed me outta the blue. then she got up, talked about her relationship...


and she left for a bit, came back and kissed me. then it led to the bed. it wasn't the best **** ever but we did it twice. once when we were tipsy and another time the next morning (a few hours ago).


so now here i am. i told her about the things she told me about her relationship and she immediately left with guilt.

a little background, him and i have a friendly adversarial relationship... he gives me **** because i don't like platformers (aka cup head and mario) i troll him that he's a giant lotr fan who didn't even know who tom bombadil was. anyway, he agrees to teach me the ways of the pen tool and layered images... because what else should productive employees be doing at 10 pm 14 hours into the workday, while the project burns around them besides spending 30 mins making memes. 

i start to get a bad feeling when he quickly finds an old photo of me off google and starts to cut it out... a few mins later the cubicle row is cheering him on as he demonstrates different techniques by grafting my face into a stock photo. i laugh, but really i'm dying inside while i watch him visually craft me into a torrid love affair with a much older woman.

the next morning i come into work to find that he'd passed the image off to the other graphic artists on the team and they'd designed our companies new christmas cards featuring me and my photoshopped love affair with an older woman. the worst part of it all? he was moving too fast by the end so the only thing i can do to battle the shame is put a hat on a meme :(","asked an exhausted, talented designer to show me how to spice up my memes. became an office meme. still learned how to put a hat on a meme though. so... worth?",,,,,,,,,,79,Tamir,"asked an exhausted, talented designer to show me how to spice up my memes. became an office meme. still learned how to put a hat on a meme though. so... worth?",3.

last night, we were in bed and he was going down on me. we were both very ****, and my mind was a little fuzzy and distracted. at that moment i apparently decided to softly call out ""oh, james."". i barely even remember doing it as things were getting pretty good downstairs. the man i am seeing is not called james. not even a little bit. 

he immediately stopped what we were doing and got angry and upset. rightfully so. i was too **** to go home so we spent an awkward night laying next to each other in silence. his angry, mine apologetic. 

before this happened we were approaching a point where we were going to take things a step further and be in a relationship. now, i don't know if i will ever see or hear from him again.

the worst part of all this? the man's name i called out in the heat of the moment was a coworker who i am not even interested in. 

 


edit:

thank you all for your advice and encouragement. he came over and we talked about it. his feelings are still a little hurt but he was very understanding for the most part and has agreed to let the whole thing go. i still feel like an ****, but as a lot of you have said, accidents happen. thanks again to everyone out there who took time to read my post. you're all great!",called out someone else's name during sex. ruined every chance at a relationship with an amazing guy. name that i called out was just some random dude from work.,,,,,,,,,,112,Tamir,called out someone else's name during sex. ruined every chance at a relationship with an amazing guy. name that i called out was just some random dude from work.,4.

as most girls do with their girl friends, we stalked him. i noticed his hometown was very close to mine and that he even went to a school that i was supposed to go to (pay attention to this). 

yesterday, ann and her boyfriend met with me and andy for dinner. this was my first time meeting andy, but i already knew quite a bit about him. the conversation goes normally, ""where are you from?"" ""what major are you?"" etc. after finding out that we live pretty close to each other, he asks me where i went to school. after i tell him, i decide to tell him that in my senior year, my school beat his at our homecoming. he looks confused, so i insist that it happened. eventually i go quiet after realizing he never told me where he went to school.

so, my girlfriend arrives and everything goes well, they really like each other and they get along (and they still do), everything's going awesome and relieve myself since nothing went grong that day.

fast forward to later that night, it's getting late so i went to drop g at her parents and we talk about how well everything went and how that is really good since we want our parents to be ok with our relationship since it's really serious and important to our lives.

so i head home and my mom receives me anxious to talk about how she feels about g. she actually loved her and is really happy that we found each other. 

then it happens.

she starts talking about how cute she is and i feel great, but the last words are still echoing sometimes inside my head when i think i already forgot them.

she says that she looks a lot like her younger sister, i guess she didn't realize the weight of her words but i, being the analytical wierdo that i am, realize something.

so far, the only person i've told this is a used-to-be-close friend of mine, and that was because she nagged me until i told her what was wrong.
at first she didn't know how to react and tried to awkwardly cheer me up by saying such things as ""you shouldn't feel this way"" and ""you have a good life"", etc. many times i tried to explain that this wasn't me not wanting to find joy in life, and that it was me being physically unable to do so, but she kept insisting that i being too negative. either way, having someone to support me made me feel like i could crawl my way out of this hole i had been living in.

time went by and on valentine's day, she confessed having feelings for me... she knew about how i felt for her, so we ended up in a strange situation where she was my best friend who acted like my girlfriend in secret and was also a sort of my therapist, this didn't last much... eventually she confessed she didn't really have such strong feelings for me and that she'd been acting like that in order to cheer me up. this revelation crushed me due to some past events that i won't be discussing right now. but on the bright side, she also said that she actually grew fond of me to the point were no acting was needed anymore, so we continued our ""relationship"" until yesterday.

after putting up with me during many of my ups and downs, she grew tired of it and decided to give up. she gave me a lengthy rant about how tired she was of my negative attitude and cynicism, how tired she was of trying to help me change only for me to have another episode. her final words were basically ""talk to me when you're feeling better, and if you never do, then never talk to me again"".

but anyways, so there's joseph, sarah, and claire. joseph and sarah were the ones who recently got out of a relationship. anyways, so i edit chats between sarah and me, and claire and me. now both of these chats were edited to saying things like ""i like joseph but don't tell him"". and then i screenshotted my work.

so then i went to joseph and started telling him about this, and of course he didn't believe me and wanted proof, so i sent him the pictures. and then **** went down.

he then starts telling me about he had sorta started having feelings for sarah after both of them broke up, and now i'm feeling really bad because i don't want him to do something **** with her because all 5 of us are really close friends. (john was dating sarah before they split so now you can kinda see the vultures circling..)

anyways, so i flat out tell him it was a prank by me and joseph so he doesn't do anything **** and boom it was a trap to get me to admit it. and then he tells sarah and claire.

now, sarah and claire and get mad us. i don't really get too much of a yelling because everyone knows i pull **** **** like this.(sidenote: john and joseph got in a sorta slap fight in which joseph gets hurt and cries. tensions rose from that because people made fun of him for crying, but joseph and john try to put it behind them)

now, john is getting all this **** thrown in his face for ""giving no **** about his and sarah's old relationship"" and for ""fucking with people too much and not taking the repercussions"".

my girlfriend of almost 2 years broke up with me. she isn't very specific about the details, but she said ""i should watch who i talk to and what i say about her"" and that she was done with me. me thinking i can't really think of anyone i hold close enough that i would talk to about let's call her jessica. 
i'll start off by saying we have a kid on the way and that scares me even more because now i might have to fight for my child. 

there has been points in our relationship where jessica has caused a fight or i may have myself and i say stuff that i don't mean but never directly too her, but always to people i trust. she won't even explain to me who said what or even what was said. so i cannot begin to solve this problem with her, and the fact that she trusts them over anything i would say to her really grinds my gears because about 6 months in our relationship she left me for a month and started dating one guy and then had **** with another and i took her back no questions asked and still had full trust in her and would let her explain herself before i ever accused her of something. our relationship seemed like a lot of me doing the work and this is any easy way out for her.

okay, so this actually happened four years ago, during a cold winter. this is all in texas, so the temperature can fluctuate like a ****. i had a friend, a close friend, who was the only person i could ever really talk to very well. all the things that i wouldn't talk to other people about, i could talk to her about, and she was one of the only people who i never felt like i had to wear a mask around. basically, i was crushing hard. like, dreaming about her and ****. i never did anything about it, however. why? simple, because i was and still am a frightened little ****. so we remained just friends for quite a long time.

after a while, she actually attempted to move our relationship up a level. she asked me out on a date. as she did so, we both visibly reddened. i was ecstatic, though i didn't show it through my overwhelming embarrassment. she had finally taken the step that i was too chicken-**** to take myself. we decided to just go to a small local coffee shop, and set the date for two weeks later, as she was going out of town for a family reunion soon. well, over the time that she was gone, i came down with the flu. i had never had the flu before, and of course my first time to ever get it was then. i was beating myself for putting off getting a flu shot for as long as i did, but at this point it didn't matter. i was aching, coughing and struggling to do much of anything. of course, i had to call her and cancel, no matter how much i didn't want to. i had hoped that maybe once i had recuperated we could reschedule the date. quite retardedly, however, i never thought to contact her and suggest that.

fairly soon after, possibly even before i was well, she met someone else online, and started going out with him. i say going out, but since they lived quite far apart, it was just chatting online. it ruined my chance at a relationship, however. now, it's four years later, we're both twenty, she's moved away and is still seeing him, and i've been alone ever since.

my girl tells me to take my time and really pushes me to do what i want, as long as i share the news with her.

fast forward to 2 days ago, we are texting about a spending a weekend in london. she has to go there for a work meeting and i am quite flexible to combine it with work. that same morning i accepted the offer from nyc. so as i chat with her i say.

  so we spend from about 3am - 6am fooling around and getting absolutely nasty. eventually its time to sleep, and she drops the bomb. although she had told me she was 25, and certainly looked and acted the part, she was in fact only 16... which is why she introduced me to her father for consent.. i'm 30. i didnt panic, and still spent the night in her bed, but come the next day i am left speechless, unsure of how to continue this 'relationship.'","i brough a minor too a bar i frequent, got her drunk, than proceeded to sleep with her with her fathers consent. fml",,,,,,,,,,140,Tamir,"i brough a minor too a bar i frequent, got her drunk, than proceeded to sleep with her with her fathers consent. fml",5.

fast forward 15 seconds of waiting, the door opens and i prepare to strike! once she walks out i leave my spot from against the wall and go to grab her waist from behind. the next thing i realize is feeling a quick strike of pain to my face, seeing stars, and laying on the floor. 

by this point, she is screaming, i'm cursing, her parents are probably thinking we're having **** in their house. i'm no small guy either at 6'2, 190 lbs (not saying i'm big, but i've started varsity at offensive line for a few years now), and just finished my senior year of football, but she took me down in one hit.

well, when i finished it on wednesday afternoon, uploaded it to the website we were suppose to submit it through and clicked ""ok."" i enjoyed my long weekend until this very afternoon (two days after the deadline).  i logged onto the website i submitted it to only to realize it did not take my submission.  

i assume it was because of a glitch. well, i decided to upload another file and i noticed after i uploaded it and clicked ""ok"" i had to click another button that said ""submit."" 

****.

because i did not click one button, i lost 10% of my grade.  one mouse click was the difference in a letter grade.  this is also the second time i uploaded the file; i should have known what i was doing.  i am so salty right not.",tifu by not submitting a 100-point assignment.,,,,,,,,,,200,Tamir,tifu by not submitting a 100-point assignment.,4.

burger chains sell a lot of soda, especially now during summer when the temperature's getting up there. so, naturally, they need a lot of soda to sell. but, because it's more efficient, they get a more syrup-y liquid that they mix with carbonated water when it's sold. because coca cola is the most popular soda to be ordered, they get more of it than other syrups. they get boxes with bags inside, measuring 250 liters (about 66 gallons). 

instead of taking this box down to the ground floor like they're supposed to, the delivery man left this large box at the top of a couple steps of stairs. there's a diagonal lift installed, all you have to do is get the hand pallet truck and load it onto the lift, and hold the ""descend"" button.

**fuckup starts**  
there was a bump, the spot where a metal flap hinges on the actual lift, it's there so you can actually drive the hand trucks onto the thing, and i couldn't get over it. so i put some muscle into it, got myself a tiny bit of extra momentum to get over the bump and onto the lift with these 250 liters of syrupy blackness.

the reason this post is here. i went too far, it tumbled over the edge, hand truck and all, i screamed ""no no no no!"", like any ****-upper would, and after standing around panicking for a good 3 minutes, co-workers coming to check what the screaming and crashing was about, i had to spend the rest of my shift cleaning up with a rubber scraper, shoving all of this sticky goo into the sewers. silver lining, four of the bigger bosses didn't arrive until after most of it was cleaned up. took around 2 and a half hours.

,217,evaluation,work,tldr,getting sick.,2,1,0.75,2,"2 months ago i was having dinner in a restaurant with my father. i was stressed and not having such a good day which started to work out on my stomach. when that happens my throat starts to burn up and i get these puke reflexes. normally only the food comes out but this time started puking blood. at the restaurant. obviously that freaked the living **** out of me, got taken to a hospital and was examined after the puking stopped. i had to stay the night (which was pretty horrible thanks to my snoring 'roommate') and in the morning got a gastroscopy.

the tests indicated i had inflammations in my stomach and esophagus, which along with the stress and puking caused a little artery to rupture. it looked more severe than it actually was, and i just needed to take some meds for a few months.

my mom's medical insurance (via her work) covers the entire family, so we sent an application to them along with some paperwork from the hospital. they asked for details of the gastroscopy and the notes of the specialist. so we mailed him, and he his discontent for having to send this but in the end he did, reluctantly. 

weeks go by and we get a mail back from the insurance company that they more details and requested all the details from the blood tests that were taken. knowing what a **** he's been about sending his notes, my mom and i kind of feared for what would happen. he sent us the blood results but demanded that all requests happened through **him** and not us, and requested to see all the paperwork and demands the insurance company sent to us. so we did, but that wasn't enough for him:

we got a call from his secretary, who told us he wanted that the insurance company sent him a letter, directly addressed to him (since all the previous ones were addressed to my mother). we called the insurance company, who responded with a ""we'll look into it"" and afterwards a ""we won't do that"". seems as if mr. specialist stepped on some toes.

so here we are. am i wrong to think that guy is a major pain in the ****?","got sick and was sent to the hospital for tests. insurance asked for details of the tests, doctor refused to send them and asked for a formal application from the insurance. insurance didn't want to play ball and send it so now i'm stuck in the middle.**",,,,,,,,,,217,Tamir,"got sick and was sent to the hospital for tests. insurance asked for details of the tests, doctor refused to send them and asked for a formal application from the insurance. insurance didn't want to play ball and send it so now i'm stuck in the middle.**",1.

see this is how it is, i’m a 20 year old college student who lives at home, the last 3 days at college has been absolute **** because of finals in preparation for the summer exams so i’ve been really stressed and busy, on top of that my father has been in and out of hospital with various illnesses, basically it’s been tough of late. 

last night after sorting out my final work, coming home late, cooking for the family and sorting everything out i went to play some videogames with an online friend, i believed i deserved a break from all this stress, afterwards i stayed up late browsing reddit and talking to friends so by the time i settled down to sleep it was almost 3am.  i vaguely remembered my mother mentioning she wanted me to go grocery shopping the next morning but i didn’t really think about it.  

this morning i got woken by an angry mother yelling at me that she would have to go buy groceries because i was still asleep, this was like 11am, apparently she had tried to wake me but i’m a very heavy sleeper in the mornings and had no recollection of that.  next thing i hear an almighty bang so loud i thought the door had been ripped off.  mother was home carrying heavy shopping bags and swearing all sorts as me as i run down to the kitchen clearly just out of bed.  she was furious that i had not woken up and helped her inside with the bags, she was soooooo disappointed.  i felt like **** about this naturally and any motivation to do anything on my day off melted away.  later when bringing my father his medicine and food he too reprimanded me for being an awful daughter and reminding me of my mother’s heart condition and saying i should take better care of her and not let her down like that (which i rarely ever do, i just wanted a break) so now i feel even more like a waste of space and i just want to crawl into a hole and hide for the rest of my life.","i just wanted a break from my stressful life, ended up making my aging, ailing parents hate my guts",,,,,,,,,,218,Tamir,"i just wanted a break from my stressful life, ended up making my aging, ailing parents hate my guts",3.

so, my school has multiple buildings that unlock with an id card. the doors are unlocked between classes so people wouldn't have to constantly unlock the doors.

today, for whatever reason, the doors were locked. i was heading to first period -- which is in a different building from where we have to stand before school starts -- and couldn't get into my building. my id wasn't working, which was odd, but it was okay since someone was leaving the building.

there's stairs almost immediately upon entering the building, and as i'm going up them i hear the door close. naturally, i figure that people would use their id to get in. i get to the landing, look back because i hear tugging on the door. they're locked out -- so i don't think ids were working at all.
i point and laugh at them because while we're not necessarily friends, i can joke with them like that.

have you ever turned a corner at the same time someone else did, and you both temporarily stop right before a collision?

it was kind of like that. i turned around, and walked right into an open door. talk about instant karma.
i hope no one saw, but i knew they did... because they mentioned it a minute or so later when they managed to get in... and then they brought it up in government, four hours later.

so, naturally, that would be the end of it, right?

well, i got a call from my school a few hours ago that there was a security breach right around the time school let out, that the police were investigating, and we didn't have school tomorrow -- that's gotta be the worst/best reason to not have school.

i learned from my local news website that they're, naturally, going to be checking security footage.

that means someone's most likely going to be looking at the footage -- especially since this was first thing in the morning, near the entrance of a building -- and see my **** running into a **** door. i hope it amuses them.","had moment of instant karma, the police might see it.",,,,,,,,,,230,Tamir,"had moment of instant karma, the police might see it.",2.

i was maybe 15 or 16 and on school vacation when my mom landed her first job selling real state after being a home stay mom for most of my life. so to celebrate i wanted to make something for her, you know, being a good son and all. i went through her cookbooks and found a recipe for flan that went just like the one in the gif (seriously try it). it was the first time i cooked anything other than a fried egg and it was going surprisingly well. the caramel melted nicely, the flan was smooth with zero chunks and everything was going according to plan. now, the recipe stated that before putting the flan in the fridge it had to cool down a bit towards room temperature, so i left it there and came later to check the temp.   

at this point i'd already **** up once. you see, nowhere in my recipe did it say that the caramel and flan should be on the same mold (i figured you make the caramel and puour it on the flan when it's done), but i didn't know it at the time. the real **** was when i went to check the temperature, when i chose to just dip my finger in the flan, which was warm, followed by the caramel, which was hotter than a thousand hells. resulted on a 2^nd degree burn of my finger, mom had to take to the er after work and we returned hours later to a busted flan (i didn't put it in the fridge) and the caramel had hardened so we ended up throwing the whole thing out.",southamerican flan is nothing like american pie.,,,,,,,,,,295,Tamir,southamerican flan is nothing like american pie.,1.

skip forward to a few hours ago; i had it on display in public, just to prepare for an event that i had set up. 

so i let people play on it. some time goes by and i notice a strange behaviour on the screen. so i decide to take a close look. upon inspection it seemed fine, nothing special, but i was still wondering why the screen acted so weird. i just thought it was an error with thr hdmi cable or something, so i didn't bother.

i decided to walk away for a few minutes to get some water and when i came back i saw the screen turn off and i felt a smell of burnt plastic coming from the arcade. so i ran to to it, i pulled out the plug and noticed a small light from the inside. 

so i opened it up to find out that one of the cables leading to the screen has caught fire. and at this point i was just trying to protect the other components so i just pulled the plug to the arcade and put out the fire.

but the damage had already been done. a couple of cables are now damaged and i have no screen anymore, so i won't be able to show off my arcade during the event, which sucks tbh.

i was about nine, and i had a bowling ball. i don’t know why i had a bowling ball, but i thought it would be kind of awesome if i rolled the ball down the incline leading to my neighbor’s garage door. which i did. i let the ball go, and watched in anticipatory horror as the ball gathered speed, began to bounce, went airborne, and became a **** cannonball which even the garage door could not resist. the ball hit the door at full force, cracking it into pieces, leaving a gigantic hole and splintered wood. 

of course, i ran away and never told anyone. for weeks, my neighbors fumed about the “vandal” that had destroyed their garage. i kept my mouth shut and years passed. my family moved away, so i never saw the neighbors as an adult.

until a few years ago, when i was pitching a potential new client. this was a huge media organization and the job was worth about five grand - and generally would mean many more jobs and dollars for years to come. i walked into the executive editor’s office, and recognized the name: this was the daughter of the neighbors. she was a few years older than me, and i instantly mentioned - because when you’re pitching, any kind of connection has to be good, right - that i grew up in the same neighborhood, and had in fact lived right across the street.

this went so well that the small talk continued to the point where i laughingly revealed the garage incident. this did *not* go over well. she stared at me, icily, and said: “leave this office before i have you removed.”

i hightailed it and, needless to say, did not get the job i’d hoped. to this day, i’m pretty much blackballed at that outfit.","- as a kid, i kind of accidentally destroyed my neighbor’s garage. when they found out about it four decades later, i lost a lucrative job.",,,,,,,,,,303,Tamir,"- as a kid, i kind of accidentally destroyed my neighbor’s garage. when they found out about it four decades later, i lost a lucrative job.",5.

so before moving out of my moms for college, we decided i needed to donate all my old novels and picture books to children less fortunate. my aunt heard about the plan and asked if we could donate the books to a family with 6 children that lived on her street, who's parents she had dinner with form time to time. i donated the novels to a local rec center, and packed the old picture books into a big box and sent them off with my aunt.

now as a kid ,(10-12) i used to take art classes outside of school. i also watched a lot of anime on tvs and from vcrs my neighbour brought. predictably, typical **** art inclined 12 year old decides to draw girls pegging girls in his sketchbook. now, these weren't just any lewd poses of anime girls. these were **** girls  doing hella weird ****. i knew from the moment i drew them that they could never see the light of day. so where does my mom never look? my old kiddie picture books.

while all of the parents were outside setting up the campfire and food, all of the kids were hanging out inside my cool tent trailer, including the 7 year old girl. being the **** preteens we were, the other guys and i did this thing where we would make the little girl answer yes/no questions about things she wouldn't understand so that we could laugh at her. we would ask her things from ""are you a **** sapien?"" all the way to extreme stuff like ""do your parents support fascism?"". basically, depending on whether she said yes or no, we had a 50/50 shot of making her say something we could laugh at her for.

we did this for a short while, and then i had the brilliant idea of asking her this: ""are you a heterosexual?""

here's where the story begins. the rocking boat, scorching sun, and cheap tequila hangover were bad enough; then about two hours in i get the urge to explosively **** my shorts. no bathroom. i didn't want to move, but i decided taking a good ole fashion aqua-deuce is better than **** on the deck. i grab some goggles, get in the water and swim away from the group of people. i figure i'm a good distance away, dive down a little, pull my shorts down and let loose. this was some next level ****. there's **** floating all around me, and that`s when i realize that fish **** love ****. tons of fish start pecking at it, and at this point some of the snorkelers are heading over since there's so many fish. i panic because i'm surrounded by my own feces so i just start wack-a-mole-ing the floating turds, trying to break them up. this causes more fish to come and more snorkelers as well. before i know it, i'm surrounded by fish and snorkelers... and we are all swimming in my ****. in the end i'm not sure if anyone noticed my **** floating around, but it was still embarrassing as ****.

    the cinema is like a plaza and all the screens are above each other connected by two stairways. one goes to the reception via the entrance lady's bathroom and the other one via the men's, or so i thought.
    i mentioned to my family that i was going to the men's room as we left the screen. i nonchalantly walked down the stairs and i did my business, once finished i carried on walking downstairs to what i thought was the reception. i was acting too 'cool' to realise that i just walked through a double door labeled 'fire exit'.
    i was taken aback when i realised that this was not the reception and instead a small room with a big window door thing, with a label across it saying 'this door is alarmed at all times even when the cinema is open' 
    i then realised i **** up and tried to turn back and leave to find that the door could only be opened from the inside. ****. i was locked in a room where one wall was just a window. to add insult to injury, everyone from the cinema could see me and my embarrassment. i quickly phoned my dad and pleaded him to save me.
    after 5 minutes of laughing at me through the window he finally agreed and made his way towards the mens room. (i later on found out he got lost and walked right through a screen showing 'my old lady')
    my guilt and sadness turned to excitement when the door next to me opened up and he stepped inside laughing at me. he was so preoccupied with laughing at me that he forgot to hold the door open and it closed on him too like a horrible, horrible trap. i will never forget his face when he realised that he too was locked in.

so, i'm back home with the family for summer break. i live on the other side of the country for school so communication between me and my parents has been sparse outside of occasional phone calls. naturally, they wanted to see how my college experience has been the past several months. having anticipated this, i was careful ahead of time to peruse through and remove any suspicious-looking thumbnails such as booze, partying, hookups, etc.

what i didn't catch was a picture of my toilet water i had taken after a (rather) painful dump and the toilet paper ran red upon wiping my delicate puckered orifice. normally, i would've just flushed and been done with it but i felt a strange non-diarrhetic sensation dripping out of my **** and falling into the clear water below. i peered into the crapper and saw that blood had dripped into the toilet water such that it spread in a ring-like pattern in the likeness of a red watery tree trunk whirlpooling into the delicate petals of a flower born from a bloody colon. of course i had to take a picture of it. while photographing my **** art, i also ended up also taking a picture of my ****, which i later cropped out on my iphone. what i didn't know was that cropping on your phone does not actually crop the original image.

so, of course, as i display my journeys in college from hanging out with friends to eating exotic foods to my family, bam, there on the screen was a picture of my bloody ringed toilet water. normally, it would've been somewhat hard to tell what it was out of context, but my friggen **** was in the picture complete with some fuzziness in its uncropped glory. ensue awkwardness. family pretends nothing was there, but the elephant in the room had been birthed, almost as disgustingly as what was on my screen.

maya took a fondness to hair ties  after a few months and chased after them when we shot them. not long after that she realized we would shoot them again if she brought them back. we were  stoked! i'd personality never owned cats, let alone played fetch with a cat, so thought it was awesome at first.

 this quickly escalated to an obsession for maya, she would hunt and retrieve  forever if you let her,  i once did it for 7 hours straight!  she began having withdrawals as we scaled back the hair tie game. she brought hair ties to us everytime we came home,  and eventually started perching next to us at night with a hair tie set beside us. she would stare indefinitely through the night, lightly tapping on our faces to pay attention to her and play some **** hair tie. 

enter stella. stella is a new addition to the family and she is a really dumb cat with crossed eyes, and a beautiful coat. she and maya immediately take to each other and sure enough they become cat bros  (sis'?). 

stella watched and learned from maya, and eventually became attached to a particular orange fuzzy cat toy. she runs around with it in her mouth like a dog,  hides it, sleeps with it, furiously attacks and rolls around with it... but then she began mimicking maya by playing fetch,  and we were naive enough to play along  (it was/is still pretty **** cute).

flash forward to last night in which they both perched over my fiance and i all **** night. they just sat there silently staring at us, poking our faces with their little bean toe pads, purring in disapproving tones. it got creepy so i kicked them out of the room,  at which point they proceeded to attack the carpet at the threshold of the door until i got up and got them to stop. they immediately picked up their respective fetch toys in their mouth and looked up at me patiently.  

i have created annoying fetch monsters.

so my aunt, who lives outside the city, visits the whole family every once in a while. she has this adorable son, who's 3 years old, just like my sister, let's call him m. anyways, both of them wanted to play outside, so my dad went with them. so after almost an hour of couch surfing and browsing, i decided to finally show myself and do something with my cute little cousin, so i went outside and just tried to enjoy the weather, talk, kick a ball around, just anything to entertain myself. then m comes by and tries to tell me something, he's pointing at a basketball, then points at the net. so i tell myself ""oh no biggie nothing will happen, he probably knows how to hold a ball"" and proceed to lift m and let him sit on my shoulders after he picked up the basketball from the hard concrete flooring of our backyard.

he looks down and says ""now?"", and i tell him ""yeah go ahead!"". for some reason i'm only (barely) holding his legs. as soon as he attempts to lift the ball he loses balance and falls head first on the ground. ****. ****. what the **** do i do now!!??? before i even make sense of the situation my whole family is running up to m, who is obviously crying, shrieking and screaming, and i'm getting told off and shouted at by about 4 people at the same time. after calming down, i went up to m to apologize and he has a lump the size of an egg on the side of his head. thank **** his mother wasn't there at the time.",had a complete brainfart and almost opened up a 3 year old's head,,,,,,,,,,426,Tamir,had a complete brainfart and almost opened up a 3 year old's head,4.

,429,evaluation,family,tldr,choking my girlfriend,228,67,0.9200000167,228,"hey reddit! this happened on sunday. 

so there i was, half in the bag at my best friend's engagement and housewarming party. family and friends were gathered all around his well decorated new living room. everyone is having a delightful time. the room is buzzing with side conversations, light music is playing in the back ground, his new fiance is cooking some small appetizers with the other ladies and the guys are all drinking beer and chit-chatting about finishing the basement, how nice the driveway is and how great he (best friend) is doing. 

my girlfriend (my shy, very intelligent, beautiful girlfriend) is sitting in between two of the oldest friends of the couple's family. i sit next to her and gently place my hand on her thigh to let her know that i'm there. she smiles and whispers to me, asking for a bottle of water. i return quickly in my idiotic stupor and hand it to her like a good dog. she, given her sense of humor, eye-balls be from the side and dramatically throws her head back as if to take a long, slow drink of this sweet nectar of the gods. 

when out of nowhere i squeeze the water bottle, ramming +8oz of water down her throat.

immediately i see her eyes get huge and she begins to choke, spitting water all over her new pants, sweater, floor and almost throwing up on the family friends while i run around the kitchen looking for paper towels. 

i apologized immediately after, wondering why the **** it seemed so funny in my head, while she laughed and cried hysterically. (yes, she thought it was hilarious.) the only other people who thought it was a riot was my brother, best friend and his fiance. 

everyone else was baffled by ""how much of an **** that i am,"" and proceeded to spend the rest of the evening giving me dirty looks, making snarky comments like *""if you don't want to ride home with him, you don't have to""* and the like.",made my shy girlfriend deep throat the contents of a poland springs bottle in front of old people at an engagement party and spent the evening being judged.,,,,,,,,,,429,Tamir,made my shy girlfriend deep throat the contents of a poland springs bottle in front of old people at an engagement party and spent the evening being judged.,5.

so i went to the play, enjoyed the whole thing, and went on my way out. as i walked through the exit door i saw her standing outside with her family and i ran over to give her a hug and tell her she did a great job. unfortunately, the play bill was in my hand and when i reached my arm around her the corner of it flew into her eye. she didn't think much of it first, just said ""ow"" and rubbed it for a minute.

my family were travelers when i was a kid; we'd have a big trip maybe every one or two years, and would do some shorter road-trips in between. due to the fact that me and my sibling were, 1. children stuck in a car, and 2. big readers, my parents used to rent and play books on tape during long drives. 

the tapes we usually rented were pretty tame, maybe some harry potter or similar fiction novels. i can't for the life remember what this book was, but am assuming it was some sort of historic fiction. of course with this came some themes that my 7-year old brain wasn't able to handle, or contextualize, or understand, and vocab to follow suit. 

at some point the reader said the n word, and repeated it in dialogue. i can only assume my parents froze up, since they weren't the type of folks to talk about anything remotely 'heavy'. i asked them what it meant. no one answered. i asked them again, probably louder. still, no one answered. after asking three or four times what the word meant, and having no one answer me, i *clearly* remember chanting it, calling my very white suburban parents it, and laughing as no one else said a word. my sibling turned to me and told me to stop saying it, so i did. 

still no one told me what it meant, and i'm certain i tried to use it in everyday conversation because i was a stuck up know-it-all kid. sigh.",don't chant derogatory words in confined spaces.,,,,,,,,,,449,Tamir,don't chant derogatory words in confined spaces.,4. Very guilty

i was going through this stage where i wanted to prank everyone and everything. i have no earthly idea why. 

now, to start off with this story, let me tell you about my father and i's relationship. my father and i never really bunted heads with each other, and we would always make each other laugh. it's been ages since i made him disgruntled in the slightest. so naturally i had my guard down on this certain weekend. 

it was a weekend night, and my extended family came over for a party (i don't remember why). everyone was having a good time and my dad came home from work, greeted everyone, and then immediately changed into his weekend clothes which consisted of pajama pants and a t-shirt. i myself was having fun. but being my idiotic fourteen year old self, i noticed my dad's ""loose"" pajama pants and decided i had to get a load of it. 

""it is perfect,"" i thought to myself. so i snuck up to my father, grabbed his pants by his waists, and slid them off faster than ever. i smiled and laughed, expected everyone else including my father to join in, but after 2 seconds i saw my dad's red face when he went and pulled his pants back up. everyone was quiet. i look over him and noticed my 6 year old sister was right in front of my dad when i ""pantsed"" him. she probably saw the bulge up close.  

my dad didn't say anything, but i could see that he didn't want to talk at all. he went in his room and didn't come out for the rest of the night. 

i was terrified for the punishment. i was never in trouble and the anticipation was murderous. i just pulled my dads pants in front of 7+ family and especially my little sister. 

but alas, my dad came down to my room when everyone was gone, and told me not to do that ever again and just walked away after that. it still haunts me to this day, and i bet my father feels the same.","now this happened when i was at the mere age of 14.

now, to start off with this story, let me tell you about my father and i's relationship. my father and i never really bunted heads with each other, and we would always make each other laugh. it's been ages since i made him disgruntled in the slightest. so naturally i had my guard down on this certain weekend. 

it was a weekend night, and my extended family came over for a party (i don't remember why). everyone was having a good time and my dad came home from work, greeted everyone, and then immediately changed into his weekend clothes which consisted of pajama pants and a t-shirt. i myself was having fun. but being my idiotic fourteen year old self, i noticed my dad's ""loose"" pajama pants and decided i had to get a load of it. 

""it is perfect,"" i thought to myself. so i snuck up to my father, grabbed his pants by his waists, and slid them off faster than ever. i smiled and laughed, expected everyone else including my father to join in, but after 2 seconds i saw my dad's red face when he went and pulled his pants back up. everyone was quiet. i look over him and noticed my 6 year old sister was right in front of my dad when i ""pantsed"" him. she probably saw the bulge up close.  

my dad didn't say anything, but i could see that he didn't want to talk at all. he went in his room and didn't come out for the rest of the night. 

i was terrified for the punishment. i was never in trouble and the anticipation was murderous. i just pulled my dads pants in front of 7+ family and especially my little sister.

i had 1500 saved up finally and we both planned for me to be there 2 months from now. i was getting things in order and yesterday i came home to find my window was broke and someone had broken in. i had the money hidden well and my mess up was not having it in a bank account somewhere. unfortunately i know who did it but can't prove it. so now i am sitting here absolutely broken.

i don't know what to tell my girlfriend. i feel lost now. my plan is shattered and because i was incredibly ****. i am going to talk to her on friday. i'm just not sure what i am going to say. she was depending on me to be there with her and start a life together. a life we have been waiting so long on. i have a feeling this will tear us apart. i don't want it to.

all i have done since i found out is call the police and make a report. other than that, i have sat on my bed and mostly crying as i message her and pretending to be okay. she is wondering why i won't skype with her. just telling her i don't feel good. please someone learn from this story and don't do what i did. i feel incredibly **** and i essentially ruined my life.","this is my tifu. i did this yesterday actually and kind of almost been paralyzed with not knowing what to do. i feel like i messed up my life with this mistake. i have been planning a trip to go live with my girlfriend. we have had a long distance relationship for 4 years now. we have been planning me moving there for a full year and a half now. i have been meticulously saving back money for awhile for everything i need to get there and get set up there.

that's where i should have stopped but i didn't. instead i kept messaging her and asking if she was down to hang out. she agreed to watch a movie with me. i didn't find it romantic at all but we did talk a bit after getting out of the theater and plus we ate together. we shook hands and parted ways.



then she told me she needs her laptop fixed and so i went to her place, fixed it and she told me she'd repay me. we went out for coffee and then we went back to my place. i showed her around and she enjoyed hearing me play the guitar. 


she texted me the following days about how the guitar was something she didn't expect to see from me. we messaged a little more after that.

ps. she did tell me numerous times before that she likes me a whole lot...",,,,,,,,,,516,Tamir,"so here's the deal. about a month ago i met this gorgeous girl at a party. we didn't hit it off so well because apparently i was being a little jerk to her and on top of that i was drunk. i got her name, but not her number. so fast forward a few weeks and we began hanging out. there was this one time where i asked if she would like to come with me to an event in the city and she said yes! but on the day, she said she didn't feel comfortable hanging out with me because she has a boyfriend.



that's where i should have stopped but i didn't. instead i kept messaging her and asking if she was down to hang out. she agreed to watch a movie with me. i didn't find it romantic at all but we did talk a bit after getting out of the theater and plus we ate together. we shook hands and parted ways.



then she told me she needs her laptop fixed and so i went to her place, fixed it and she told me she'd repay me. we went out for coffee and then we went back to my place. i showed her around and she enjoyed hearing me play the guitar. 


she texted me the following days about how the guitar was something she didn't expect to see from me. we messaged a little more after that.


so here we are. the weekend of november 15-16. she came over saturday night with alcohol. i knew what was going to happen but i felt like a jerk for not stopping myself. she got tipsy and i got tipsy as well. i played her a song and she kissed me outta the blue. then she got up, talked about her relationship...


and she left for a bit, came back and kissed me. then it led to the bed. it wasn't the best sex ever but we did it twice. once when we were tipsy and another time the next morning (a few hours ago).


so now here i am. i told her about the things she told me about her relationship and she immediately left with guilt.

so i head home and my mom receives me anxious to talk about how she feels about g. she actually loved her and is really happy that we found each other. 

then it happens.

she starts talking about how cute she is and i feel great, but the last words are still echoing sometimes inside my head when i think i already forgot them.

she says that she looks a lot like her younger sister, i guess she didn't realize the weight of her words but i, being the analytical wierdo that i am, realize something.

so far, the only person i've told this is a used-to-be-close friend of mine, and that was because she nagged me until i told her what was wrong.
at first she didn't know how to react and tried to awkwardly cheer me up by saying such things as ""you shouldn't feel this way"" and ""you have a good life"", etc. many times i tried to explain that this wasn't me not wanting to find joy in life, and that it was me being physically unable to do so, but she kept insisting that i being too negative. either way, having someone to support me made me feel like i could crawl my way out of this hole i had been living in.

time went by and on valentine's day, she confessed having feelings for me... she knew about how i felt for her, so we ended up in a strange situation where she was my best friend who acted like my girlfriend in secret and was also a sort of my therapist, this didn't last much... eventually she confessed she didn't really have such strong feelings for me and that she'd been acting like that in order to cheer me up. this revelation crushed me due to some past events that i won't be discussing right now. but on the bright side, she also said that she actually grew fond of me to the point were no acting was needed anymore, so we continued our ""relationship"" until yesterday.

after putting up with me during many of my ups and downs, she grew tired of it and decided to give up. she gave me a lengthy rant about how tired she was of my negative attitude and cynicism, how tired she was of trying to help me change only for me to have another episode. her final words were basically ""talk to me when you're feeling better, and if you never do, then never talk to me again"".

fairly soon after, possibly even before i was well, she met someone else online, and started going out with him. i say going out, but since they lived quite far apart, it was just chatting online. it ruined my chance at a relationship, however. now, it's four years later, we're both twenty, she's moved away and is still seeing him, and i've been alone ever since.

so i decide to go on tinder, and bam first girl i meet is amazing. she is cute, smart, funny, in other words she is the whole package. i decide to be bluntly honest with her and i tell her that i'll be leaving the country in few weeks. she says she is fine with it, as long as i am honest with her. so i start to look for opportunities abroad, and i receive an offer london close to home and one for nyc. i am struggling with the choice, as i always wanted to live in nyc and because well london isn't bad and i can manage this type of distance for the relationship. i have 15 days to answer for nyc, and a bit longer for london.

my girl tells me to take my time and really pushes me to do what i want, as long as i share the news with her.

fast forward to 2 days ago, we are texting about a spending a weekend in london. she has to go there for a work meeting and i am quite flexible to combine it with work. that same morning i accepted the offer from nyc. so as i chat with her i say.

""actually i'd love to go, so i can say goodbye to london""

discussion continues casually, then i see her yesterday we have a very nice time. i am very scared to tell her, because we have a great time and i don't want to ruin the mood :/

then we go back to my place, we are getting frisky and then she drops it: 

""what happens to your balls?""

i go ""woot?""

""well since you can't take the courage to tell me you are leaving for nyc, i figured that you lost them somewhere along the way ...""

  so i have been chatting, texting, snapchatting with this girl, let's call her e, for the past few weeks. she is a friend of a friend, and a regular at one of the bar's i frequent so i really didn't think much of it. these things happen, albeit not to me since i have made a rule too not go home with bar girls.  

  anyway, e and i decide that things are going pretty well, and agree to go on an official date. i pick her up (very far out of my way) and bring her back to a bar i frequent, as she is not a citizen of the country and has 'lost her passport' in a larger near-by city. everything goes great, the owner of the bar agrees to give her a job, and my life seems to be on easy street. we get back to her place, she introduces me to her father who seems to like me and gives me consent to spend the night with his daughter (i thought this was wierd, but it's also important.)

  so we spend from about 3am - 6am fooling around and getting absolutely nasty. eventually its time to sleep, and she drops the bomb. although she had told me she was 25, and certainly looked and acted the part, she was in fact only 16... which is why she introduced me to her father for consent.. i'm 30. i didnt panic, and still spent the night in her bed, but come the next day i am left speechless, unsure of how to continue this 'relationship.'","so this actually happened yesterday, which is rare for a tifu i know, but none the less it was kind of a shocking story...

,595,evaluation,relationship,documents,trying to scare my girlfriend.,3511,376,0.8999999762,3511,"so this **** actually did happen today, about five hours ago. 

my girlfriend had just gone downstairs and i was finishing a conversation with her parents upstairs. after finishing the conversation, i headed downstairs, i notice she's in the bathroom. being the quick-thinking guy i am, i silently run across the room and hide in the corner to wait for her to come out of the bathroom. this way, when the door opened it would be blocking her view from me. for the record, the room is pitch black - i was gonna scare her so well! 

fast forward 15 seconds of waiting, the door opens and i prepare to strike! once she walks out i leave my spot from against the wall and go to grab her waist from behind. the next thing i realize is feeling a quick strike of pain to my face, seeing stars, and laying on the floor. 

by this point, she is screaming, i'm cursing, her parents are probably thinking we're having **** in their house. i'm no small guy either at 6'2, 190 lbs (not saying i'm big, but i've started varsity at offensive line for a few years now), and just finished my senior year of football, but she took me down in one hit. 

apparently i was a murderer for a fraction of a second in the pitch black and paid the ultimate price. i'm proud of her for being able to throw out a good punch if she had to :) 

 

edit: turns out she is actually holly holm, much more accurate! thank you all for responding! glad i could make someone laugh, i can't wait to have to explain this eye to anyone who asks. 

edit 2: grammar

edit 3: huge thanks to the people who aren't trying to give me relationship advice. while i appreciate all opinions, i assure you i am not manipulative or malicious to my girlfriend. we've dated for a few years now and have laughed about this incident more than i think the average couple would! keep the comments coming, we're laughing pretty hard at some of them!

so once upon a time, about 2 years ago me, friend #1 and friend #2 decided to go tubing (for those in tropical and or have never gone tubing, tubing is basicly getting in a huge tire tube and going speeding down a snow covered hill most of the time at somesort of a skiing resort) 

anyways we were having fun time and just connect our tubes together by join hands, almost like in a triangle, but one run we decided to let go just as we started down the hill.

me and friend #2 make it down before friend #1 by a fair bit, his tube had a lot more friction causing him to slow basicly to a halt, so friend #2 gets of his tube at the end of the run a throws it into the pile of tubes to be brought back up. then he noticed that friend #1 wasn't down the hill all the way and decided to pull a mini prank on friend #2, so he planned to put his leg out and stop the tube causing friend #1 to fly off it and land in the snow. 

well it didn't work out like this, friend #2 raised his foot and misses the tube all together and ends up kicking friend #1 in the face in the freezing cold, for whom ever doesn't know hurts a metric **** ton, so friend #1 who is seeing stars and laying on the ground lays there for a few seconds. when all of a sudden a group of around 5 girls come flying down the run at moch 5 and run over him, around like three of the 5 tubes went over him.

in the end he was ok though, besides the bruse on his face and being freezing cold and friend #2 feeling like an ****.","so first off this wasn't me but i felt like this story was way to funny to waste.

burger is in front of me and i am oh so happy because it looks and smells amazing. i take a huge bit of this burger. chew. chew. chew. swallow. well that's not so bad. for about 3 seconds until the fires of **** are overflowing from my face hole. i am so red, and my wife and the couple next to us are laughing at this. my wife then decides to tell me that the burger has a dry rub and a sauce that is made with ghost peppers. needless to say, everyone got a good laugh out of this. even i did. until it was time to do the business later that night. i **** near thought my **** was going to start bleeding.

classmate:i really hate him, and i still say he did nothing.

burger chains sell a lot of soda, especially now during summer when the temperature's getting up there. so, naturally, they need a lot of soda to sell. but, because it's more efficient, they get a more syrup-y liquid that they mix with carbonated water when it's sold. because coca cola is the most popular soda to be ordered, they get more of it than other syrups. they get boxes with bags inside, measuring 250 liters (about 66 gallons). 

instead of taking this box down to the ground floor like they're supposed to, the delivery man left this large box at the top of a couple steps of stairs. there's a diagonal lift installed, all you have to do is get the hand pallet truck and load it onto the lift, and hold the ""descend"" button.

there was a bump, the spot where a metal flap hinges on the actual lift, it's there so you can actually drive the hand trucks onto the thing, and i couldn't get over it. so i put some muscle into it, got myself a tiny bit of extra momentum to get over the bump and onto the lift with these 250 liters of syrupy blackness.

last night after sorting out my final work, coming home late, cooking for the family and sorting everything out i went to play some videogames with an online friend, i believed i deserved a break from all this stress, afterwards i stayed up late browsing reddit and talking to friends so by the time i settled down to sleep it was almost 3am.  i vaguely remembered my mother mentioning she wanted me to go grocery shopping the next morning but i didn’t really think about it.  

this morning i got woken by an angry mother yelling at me that she would have to go buy groceries because i was still asleep, this was like 11am, apparently she had tried to wake me but i’m a very heavy sleeper in the mornings and had no recollection of that.  next thing i hear an almighty bang so loud i thought the door had been ripped off.  mother was home carrying heavy shopping bags and swearing all sorts as me as i run down to the kitchen clearly just out of bed.  she was furious that i had not woken up and helped her inside with the bags, she was soooooo disappointed.  i felt like **** about this naturally and any motivation to do anything on my day off melted away.  later when bringing my father his medicine and food he too reprimanded me for being an awful daughter and reminding me of my mother’s heart condition and saying i should take better care of her and not let her down like that (which i rarely ever do, i just wanted a break) so now i feel even more like a waste of space and i just want to crawl into a hole and hide for the rest of my life.","dear reddit, today i fucked up by trying to take a break

this morning i got woken by an angry mother yelling at me that she would have to go buy groceries because i was still asleep, this was like 11am, apparently she had tried to wake me but i’m a very heavy sleeper in the mornings and had no recollection of that.  next thing i hear an almighty bang so loud i thought the door had been ripped off.  mother was home carrying heavy shopping bags and swearing all sorts as me as i run down to the kitchen clearly just out of bed.  she was furious that i had not woken up and helped her inside with the bags, she was soooooo disappointed.  i felt like shit about this naturally and any motivation to do anything on my day off melted away.  later when bringing my father his medicine and food he too reprimanded me for being an awful daughter and reminding me of my mother’s heart condition and saying i should take better care of her and not let her down like that (which i rarely ever do, i just wanted a break) so now i feel even more like a waste of space and i just want to crawl into a hole and hide for the rest of my life.",,,,,,,,,,668,Tamir,"dear reddit, today i fucked up by trying to take a break

there's stairs almost immediately upon entering the building, and as i'm going up them i hear the door close. naturally, i figure that people would use their id to get in. i get to the landing, look back because i hear tugging on the door. they're locked out -- so i don't think ids were working at all.

have you ever turned a corner at the same time someone else did, and you both temporarily stop right before a collision?

eventually i lean over and kiss her. and you, know i like her, i felt like just making out cause i don't have a lot of confidence in my own sexual skills. but she starts unbuttoning her shirt and i panic: i haven't shaved in 5 months and haven't jerked off in a week so i know i would climax way too quickly.  i pull away and she looks at me with a confused look and i just lay there, looking at the ceiling. she turns her back towards me, waits for 30 seconds and says: ""fuck this, i'm going home.""

i take the whole thing apart again and i broke something called a **** so i have to go to home depot with like 5 minutes to find a **** repair part i get the last one and head back to the apartment...

i try to replace this but now it doesn't fit right i have to smash sheet rock and the **** holes don't line up... big pain on the **** and i finally manage to get 2 screws in.

place everything back together turn the water on flush it and it works!!!

i call my gf to come on by and check out my amazing handy work and head down stairs to wet vac up the basement...

she comes over and flushes it while i'm down stairs... no joke it was like she flushed it directly thru the floor i must have gotten like 13 gallons of **** water dumped directly on my head and it also landed n the vacuum shorting it out.

i was maybe 15 or 16 and on school vacation when my mom landed her first job selling real state after being a home stay mom for most of my life. so to celebrate i wanted to make something for her, you know, being a good son and all. i went through her cookbooks and found a recipe for flan that went just like the one in the gif (seriously try it). it was the first time i cooked anything other than a fried egg and it was going surprisingly well. the caramel melted nicely, the flan was smooth with zero chunks and everything was going according to plan. now, the recipe stated that before putting the flan in the fridge it had to cool down a bit towards room temperature, so i left it there and came later to check the temp.   

at this point i'd already **** up once. you see, nowhere in my recipe did it say that the caramel and flan should be on the same mold (i figured you make the caramel and puour it on the flan when it's done), but i didn't know it at the time. the real **** was when i went to check the temperature, when i chose to just dip my finger in the flan, which was warm, followed by the caramel, which was hotter than a thousand hells. resulted on a 2^nd degree burn of my finger, mom had to take to the er after work and we returned hours later to a busted flan (i didn't put it in the fridge) and the caramel had hardened so we ended up throwing the whole thing out.","olbigaroty this didn't happen today, but some years ago. i was reminded of my fuckup from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifrecipes/comments/55ly06/brazilian_flan/?ref=share&ref_source=link) in /r/gifrecipes.

,746,evaluation,work,documents,leaving the room for a few minutes.,41,15,0.8700000048,41,"so, earlier this year i built my first arcade machine which was made using an old laptop screen, a raspberry pi and other components i found at home or got at ebay. i also got a kit  from china to make the lcd screen work with hdmi, so that i can play of course.

skip forward to a few hours ago; i had it on display in public, just to prepare for an event that i had set up. 

so i let people play on it. some time goes by and i notice a strange behaviour on the screen. so i decide to take a close look. upon inspection it seemed fine, nothing special, but i was still wondering why the screen acted so weird. i just thought it was an error with thr hdmi cable or something, so i didn't bother.

i decided to walk away for a few minutes to get some water and when i came back i saw the screen turn off and i felt a smell of burnt plastic coming from the arcade. so i ran to to it, i pulled out the plug and noticed a small light from the inside. 

so i opened it up to find out that one of the cables leading to the screen has caught fire. and at this point i was just trying to protect the other components so i just pulled the plug to the arcade and put out the fire.

but the damage had already been done. a couple of cables are now damaged and i have no screen anymore, so i won't be able to show off my arcade during the event, which sucks tbh.

i'm lucky that i saw it, or else the whole building would be in flames.","so, earlier this year i built my first arcade machine which was made using an old laptop screen, a raspberry pi and other components i found at home or got at ebay. i also got a kit  from china to make the lcd screen work with hdmi, so that i can play of course.

i was about nine, and i had a bowling ball. i don’t know why i had a bowling ball, but i thought it would be kind of awesome if i rolled the ball down the incline leading to my neighbor’s garage door. which i did. i let the ball go, and watched in anticipatory horror as the ball gathered speed, began to bounce, went airborne, and became a **** cannonball which even the garage door could not resist. the ball hit the door at full force, cracking it into pieces, leaving a gigantic hole and splintered wood. 

of course, i ran away and never told anyone. for weeks, my neighbors fumed about the “vandal” that had destroyed their garage. i kept my mouth shut and years passed. my family moved away, so i never saw the neighbors as an adult.

until a few years ago, when i was pitching a potential new client. this was a huge media organization and the job was worth about five grand - and generally would mean many more jobs and dollars for years to come. i walked into the executive editor’s office, and recognized the name: this was the daughter of the neighbors. she was a few years older than me, and i instantly mentioned - because when you’re pitching, any kind of connection has to be good, right - that i grew up in the same neighborhood, and had in fact lived right across the street.

this went so well that the small talk continued to the point where i laughingly revealed the garage incident. this did *not* go over well. she stared at me, icily, and said: “leave this office before i have you removed.”

i hightailed it and, needless to say, did not get the job i’d hoped. to this day, i’m pretty much blackballed at that outfit.","so when i was a kid, i lived on a hill. a lot of the houses had very steep driveways, including the one across the street from me; the driveway sloped down at a very acute angle, ending at a big garage door.

now as a kid ,(10-12) i used to take art classes outside of school. i also watched a lot of anime on tvs and from vcrs my neighbour brought. predictably, typical **** art inclined 12 year old decides to draw girls pegging girls in his sketchbook. now, these weren't just any lewd poses of anime girls. these were **** girls  doing hella weird ****. i knew from the moment i drew them that they could never see the light of day. so where does my mom never look? my old kiddie picture books.

so, i'm back home with the family for summer break. i live on the other side of the country for school so communication between me and my parents has been sparse outside of occasional phone calls. naturally, they wanted to see how my college experience has been the past several months. having anticipated this, i was careful ahead of time to peruse through and remove any suspicious-looking thumbnails such as booze, partying, hookups, etc.

what i didn't catch was a picture of my toilet water i had taken after a (rather) painful dump and the toilet paper ran red upon wiping my delicate puckered orifice. normally, i would've just flushed and been done with it but i felt a strange non-diarrhetic sensation dripping out of my **** and falling into the clear water below. i peered into the crapper and saw that blood had dripped into the toilet water such that it spread in a ring-like pattern in the likeness of a red watery tree trunk whirlpooling into the delicate petals of a flower born from a bloody colon. of course i had to take a picture of it. while photographing my **** art, i also ended up also taking a picture of my ****, which i later cropped out on my iphone. what i didn't know was that cropping on your phone does not actually crop the original image.

so, of course, as i display my journeys in college from hanging out with friends to eating exotic foods to my family, bam, there on the screen was a picture of my bloody ringed toilet water. normally, it would've been somewhat hard to tell what it was out of context, but my friggen **** was in the picture complete with some fuzziness in its uncropped glory. ensue awkwardness. family pretends nothing was there, but the elephant in the room had been birthed, almost as disgustingly as what was on my screen.

what i didn't catch was a picture of my toilet water i had taken after a (rather) painful dump and the toilet paper ran red upon wiping my delicate puckered orifice. normally, i would've just flushed and been done with it but i felt a strange non-diarrhetic sensation dripping out of my butthole and falling into the clear water below. i peered into the crapper and saw that blood had dripped into the toilet water such that it spread in a ring-like pattern in the likeness of a red watery tree trunk whirlpooling into the delicate petals of a flower born from a bloody colon. of course i had to take a picture of it. while photographing my ass art, i also ended up also taking a picture of my ballsack, which i later cropped out on my iphone. what i didn't know was that cropping on your phone does not actually crop the original image.

so, of course, as i display my journeys in college from hanging out with friends to eating exotic foods to my family, bam, there on the screen was a picture of my bloody ringed toilet water. normally, it would've been somewhat hard to tell what it was out of context, but my friggen ballsack was in the picture complete with some fuzziness in its uncropped glory. ensue awkwardness. family pretends nothing was there, but the elephant in the room had been birthed, almost as disgustingly as what was on my screen.

maya took a fondness to hair ties  after a few months and chased after them when we shot them. not long after that she realized we would shoot them again if she brought them back. we were  stoked! i'd personality never owned cats, let alone played fetch with a cat, so thought it was awesome at first.

 this quickly escalated to an obsession for maya, she would hunt and retrieve  forever if you let her,  i once did it for 7 hours straight!  she began having withdrawals as we scaled back the hair tie game. she brought hair ties to us everytime we came home,  and eventually started perching next to us at night with a hair tie set beside us. she would stare indefinitely through the night, lightly tapping on our faces to pay attention to her and play some **** hair tie. 

enter stella. stella is a new addition to the family and she is a really dumb cat with crossed eyes, and a beautiful coat. she and maya immediately take to each other and sure enough they become cat bros  (sis'?). 

stella watched and learned from maya, and eventually became attached to a particular orange fuzzy cat toy. she runs around with it in her mouth like a dog,  hides it, sleeps with it, furiously attacks and rolls around with it... but then she began mimicking maya by playing fetch,  and we were naive enough to play along  (it was/is still pretty **** cute).

flash forward to last night in which they both perched over my fiance and i all **** night. they just sat there silently staring at us, poking our faces with their little bean toe pads, purring in disapproving tones. it got creepy so i kicked them out of the room,  at which point they proceeded to attack the carpet at the threshold of the door until i got up and got them to stop. they immediately picked up their respective fetch toys in their mouth and looked up at me patiently.  

i have created annoying fetch monsters.

fast forward to last week. my roommate recently got into a committed relationship, just before a super hot and painfully single red-headed young woman started working where he did. he invited her over for me, and i got her number. i set up a date for lunch a few days later.

the date went well, i thought, but it was only today, five days later, that i realized my mistake. my roommate came up during the conversation, so i asked her if she thought he was cute. she told me she doesn't think of coworkers that way. i followed up by agreeing that workplace relationships are usually pretty bad times all around, adding that i had personal experience. she seemed curious, so i elaborated, i told her the whole story.

there was more conversation after that, then i drove her home so she could get to class on time. i haven't heard from her, and i've been racking my brain all weekend trying to figure out why.",i have loose moral standards and that scared off a potential great time for me. :(,3*,4,,?,4,,I have loose moral standards and that scared off a potential great time for me. :(,,1.

so let me start out by saying this; i was in an amazing relationship for the past 4 years of my life. however, one thing led to another and we ended up breaking it off. ultimately, this leads me to forgetting how to properly talk to humans of the opposite ****. 

anyways, i am working as a filmmaker in my city. i have been doing pretty well, but i took a job as a pa (production assistant) for a documentary shoot because, ""why the **** not?"" 

well, one of my duties was to wake up every day this week at 5:30 at go get the crew coffee at starbucks. easy enough. well, it got even easier. 

there was an incredibly cute girl working the early morning shifts this week. so everyday this week, i woke up, went to starbucks and flirted with this really nice, cute, smart girl for about 10-15 mins until i had to leave. 

well, yesterday was the last day of the shoot, so really, the last day that i get to see this girl. i decided i would give her my number because thats what i should do right? 

she hands me the coffee for the day and i say, ""today is the last day of the shoot, so i won't be in here again!"" 

frowning, she says, ""well, i don't work this next week, so i won't be in here either.""

and for some unexplainable reason, the following comes out of my mouth, ""good! cause i hope to never see you here again!"" 

she stops. i have a **** eating grin on my face, not realizing what i just said. 

she just says, ""thanks...have a good day."" and walks to the back. i walk to my truck, and then it hits me. but me being socially awkward, i decided not to go back inside.

i don't work or anything so last year i was 24/7 in my room watching *educational* videos and whatnot. one day i decided to look for random peeps in online chats and landed on habbo, and after a couple of minutes wandering and stalking people i came across this girl. we became friends mostly because she had depression too and etc. everything went great; for the first time since ever someone actually cared to talk to me, besides my family of course.

one day we where talking and she tells me about a guy that likes her and...my sad/cringe/maniac side activated. instead of ""hey good for you"" or some word of encouragement , i told her that i liked her and i started to send lyrics and songs (i sent her you're mine from disturbed for example), and obviously she said no, mainly because she's was from mexico and i'm from argentina so she didn't want long-distance relationship. after this i felt...bamboozled? (because i was a cringy piece of ****) and i came with a really good idea: let's told her to **** for no reason. i sent her ""give your bf a ****, he may enjoy it"" and proceeded to delete her from everything. 
next day i get a message from her confused as heck and i just ignored it and never talked to her again.

needless to say this was at the beginning of our relationship, so her parents didn't even knew me yet. her parents with siblings were gone for a football match, so we decide to have some fun till they come back. they were supposed to come back home in like 4 hours so we had a plenty of time for ourselves, but we planed it out so they won't come while we are doing it. unfortunately, when we were in the ""best"" i hear keys in the door lock, we are **** and i almost have an heart attack. i puted my pants quickly on me and ran on the other side of the apartment and jumped out of balcony (they live on the first floor) and i hided around the corner, standing barefooted in a snow with only pants and t-shirt which a managed to dress in while runing. my boots were still in the hall so there was no doubt that her parents know i'm there. after like 10 mins i couldn't already feel my feet and i was feeling like passing out, few people walked by. i was still hoping that she will throw my shoes out of the balcony and i will potentialy walk away home without her parents noticing. i couldn't wait no more and i tried to sneak under the balcony, but as soon as i sticked out my head from the corner to see on the balcony to give her atleast signal to help me out, her father was there, smoking. here comes a few seconds awkward stare contest combined with moment of suprise on both sides. at that point i didn't even gave **** what is about to happen because i have been compromised and the game is over. to my suprise he just stared at me and after some time he turned around and yelled at my gf's mom ""holy ****, i have just found him here waiting **** in snow"" he willingly invited me in, i got dressed and went back home. we have never spoken about this again.
so i guess a great way how to meet your gf's parents.

so anyways, today i was feeling pretty confident in myself for some reason. things seemed to be going pretty well, a test that i thought i would failed turned out very good, a assignment i forgot to due wasn't collected, and it was pretty nice out in socal today. 

so i decide to get my **** together and decided that i would  tell the girl i had a crush on for months now that i liked her. 

and needless to say, i was just being naive. after painfully sitting through 2 periods of class, and experiencing nervousness even worse than anything i've ever experienced i ended up feeling like a **** idiot.

she's one of those types that only studies and i knew that. doesn't help that i'm pretty average at best and shes a league above me.

got told the usual, ""aww you're so sweet, but my mom would **** me if she figured out i was in a relationship, etc."" 

now i hate optimism.

so to start things off me and my girlfriend have had a long distance relationship for the last 3 months after i moved half way across the country for school.  during this time we started doing sexy webcam shows for each other which was fun.  


then comes today.  at this point we have done these a few times and all has always ended well, then i decided to up the anti and ask her if she can make herself squirt.


so to clarify something, i use a desktop with a webcam that i can move around and she is using this macbook with a built in camera that i managed to salvage for her a couple of years ago.  this is where we **** up, and in the back of my mind i saw as an issue.  as she starts going at it she says that she doesn't think she will be able to squirt from **** because she never has before, and then as we are reaching the end of our journey all of a sudden she explodes like a geyser while aimed directly at her macbook.


i immediately have an oh **** feeling going on in my mind because i see the trajectory coming just south of the camera.  she is caught up in the moment and asking me if i saw that, and i'm shouting at her to immediately power down her laptop and turn it upside down so the liquid doesn't get to the motherboard.  about 20 seconds later our video call ends and she calls me back on her cell phone.  i ask her if she turned it off when i told her to, to which she responds that the laptop turned off by itself.  well, now we have to wait about 24 hours and hope that the thing turned itself off to save itself instead of because the whole motherboard is fried.","tried to have a sexy evening with my girlfriend via video call, ended up having her possibly ruin her laptop.",,,3.

my second thought was ""she opened my **** mail!"" because she has always opened her sons mail and continues to do so if he gets mail at her house. 

we do not live with her but we did briefly live on her property in a tiny cabin that did not have it own address or mailbox. so for a year my and my boyfriends mail was delivered to the main house mailbox. haven't lived there for 6 years now so i have no idea why stuff is still going there.

so i responded to the picture with ""why is that opened?"". to which she replied ""it's a postcard.""

back story: i've always been real close with my grandparents. i used to go to there house every other day and sit with them since i was born. now i'm 24, and this still happens. except now, my grandma still looks at me differently ever since one car ride we took about 4 years ago.

so, we were driving i forget where to - but just me and her, grandpa is at home. every time with i ride **with** my gran since a young kid i always go in the glove box and have a boiled sweet from her tin she's always kept in there(not the same tin you understand, she gets a new one when it's empty!)

so i open the tin, grab a boiled sweet, put them back in the glove and ask an innocent question :- ""hey gran, how come you always got sweets in here, when you don't even eat sweets""......""well, it's always nice to have something to **** on in the car on long journeys""....

now, if you got a dirty mind like me, you thinking the same. i'm 20 at the time so i should know better but i say - ""aha, you don't need sweets - grandpa could help you out with that"".

she just looked at me blankly and i just couldn't even. i don't know why i said it i guess i just forgot who i was talking too. we never mention this now, but i can tell she be lookin' at me a whole lotta different now.

i've been on a new diet/exercise regime for the last few weeks, and every now and then i get really hungry. i'm obsessively counting calories, so i was scouring the cabinets looking for something low-cal to eat. entire can of marinated jalapenos for only 40 calories? bingo!
so i eat the entire can of jalapenos, and go about my day. two hours later, i'm browsing the internet on the couch when i suddenly realize i must make an immediate sortie to the toilet, as bad things are about to happen.

i pull down my pants just in time to unleash a torrent of pepper oil diarrhea. my stomach is churning, and my **** is on fire. i sit on the john for a while until the pain subsides. as soon as a i stand up, i realize that i've **** not *into* the toilet, but rather all over the back of it. ****. now i suddenly understand how it happens. *now i'm one of those people.*

horrified by the mess all over the toilet and all over my backside, i tip toe out of the bathroom to the cabinet under the sink, and grab a baby wipe in one hand, and a clorox wipe in the other. cue the ****.

absconding back into the bathroom, i promptly forget which wipe was in which hand. the mistake is readily apparent once my **** is ignited into a broiling agony that rivals the deepest pits of ****. shoving a steak knife up my **** would have been a walk in the park compared to this torment.

so, i start screaming and my partner comes running, only to find me clutching my ****-covered butt in a ****-covered bathroom, sobbing. a bit much for a month old relationship...","confused the wipes, wrecked ma pipes.",,,,d,,,,,,,,,

on this day she asks, ""am i in love with her?""  

she is my heart, and of course the answer should be yes with our a doubt.  my fear of being hurt again takes over though.  my answer, while generic,  skirts the lines of both feelings.  i say something to the effect of how amazing she is and that i think that is a feeling to be grown into over time.  this was not ok and prompted an unceremonious exit from her.  

she is now done with the relationship, i am devastated.

after realising how much we liked each other we decided to meet up in tokyo before i went back to my country. we spent all of our waking time together and when we were going to bed i tried to tell her that this time it would be much easier to say good bye, i did not formulate this well...

i told her ""at least this time i won't be as sad because i have closure"".

 i could tell immediately that she was hurt by this and it was by no means what i meant to say to her, i wanted to continue the relationship. so after a couple of minutes of sincere apologising and blaming my terrible english she understood what i meant. but yeah, she told me afterwards that she was really **** about that but didn't want to ruin our ""last"" time together.",almost lost my love to translation by saying i wanted the closure.,,,3.

i didn't realize who she was for the first half hour, until i saw her **** expresion because she thought i was ignoring her. i haven't seen such expresion of rage and dissapointment at the same time, obviously it was to late to say hi, so i spent the rest of the trip pretending i didn't see her, staring at the window and playing fallout shelter.

some backstory; i'm a single, twenty something college student who took an interest in a coworker of his, but wanted to wait till the end of the quarter, as he and his coworker are generally quite busy. she's cute, seems to enjoy my sense of humor, and we make good conversation, which often manages to go well beyond the small talk of work, school, and weather. 

so today, as we work as ta's, we had a meeting with the professor to finish out the quarter. this is when i decide that today's the day, it's the end of the quarter, i'm tired of eating my meals alone, i'm gonna go for it, pull the trigger, be a man. so at the meetings end, i walk out with her, and set my charm to full power, making sure to open doors for her, and in all likely-hood, acting like a buffoon. eventually as we walk and talk, i ask her if she'd like to go to dinner (in some crazy round about way) and if she'd humor me in doing so, to which she replied, ""i'm not sure how my *boyfriend* would feel about that."" (keep in mind, the subject of her boyfriend had never come up before in the few months i've known her.) so, with my ears burning, and my face bright red, i managed to stammer my way out, trying to play it cool, as we awkwardly parted ways at the nearest fork in the crosswalk.

and now for the ""piece de résistance;"" we'll likely be ta-ing for the same class, again, next quarter....

now she has a little 8 year old daughter (we'll call her k) that i knew about going in.  in the beginning i thought it would be a good idea to be extra nice to the kid.  you know, be good to the kid as a great way of getting brownie points w/j?  at least...that's how it started.  i'd help her with schoolwork and projects and take her to toystores and out for ice cream and just having a ton of fun being a kid again (no better excuse to being a kid than being around kids, right?).  

my relationship with j was excellent, and i'm pretty sure she felt the same way.  we were seeing each other daily, and conversations never got stale.  everything was straight up cloud 9.  one day she had to work late, and i decided to suprise her by making chicken fajitas for when she got home.  so she gets home and we're eating dinner and k goes ""daddy, the chicken is too big"" (i cut them into bigger chunks rather than thin slices) and i responded ""that's because daddy isn't that good with a knife"". 

well, i could tell something was a bit off after that and it seems like she's just...distant.  later, she tells me she thinks that maybe we're moving too fast and she needs some time to think about things.  she says she didn't expect k calling me daddy to trigger her like that, but she isn't comfortable with it yet.  i tell her that's fine and we could spend some time apart.  i tell her that when she makes sense of things to let me know and i'd be there for her.

i told her how we shouldn't be together via text, about how it was college and time to discover who we are, blah, blah, blah, the whole thing. and let me tell you, i was being careful about what i texted. writing, re-writing, trying to look for the best way to describe what i was feeling without sounding like a ****.  this involved a lot of coping and pasting sections of text; like i said, it was a big deal. the finally dust settled, and i was done.

sophomore year went fine. we were friendly to each other, no animosity towards each other, all went well. until a few months before the end of school. that's when i realized how of an idiot i was. i had fallen in love with her all over again. now a week or so before i realized i was head over heels again, she had told me she was moving to texas. i live in ny so that's quite a distance. we stopped talking again after she moved for a few months. so that's the end of it right?

wrong. later she texts me and we started talking again. so guess what happens. she tells me she still loves me, even after we had been broken up. so queue resurgence of feelings. around mid-may she moves back, and we start talking more seriously. i want to start dating again, she wants us to get to know each other again. i agree and we hang out a few times (**** may have been involved) and we sort of hit it off again. 

then her best friend convinces her i'm evil because i hurt her the first time. she still says she loves me, says she does want to date me again, but she refuses to talk to me, gets mad when i don't and over all has me bending over backwards. 

i'm at my wits end, but i do really like this girl. but her friend has turned her against me and i don't really know what to do.","fell in love with a girl a few years ago, she wants to get back together, i agree, friends turn her against me and i sit here heart-broken.",,,1. Not guilty,,,,,,,,,,

so like many posts on this subreddit, this didn't happen today,but rather over a period of time

alright, to begin when i was younger i was in a youth group with close to 40 other teens so i knew a lot of the people,but not all of them. after a few years this girl lets call her katie... whom i had never talked to from this youth group added me on facebook. so not thinking much of it i accept and move on with my life. within 5 minutes she messages me, and not wanting to be rude i start talking to her, but i made it very clear i have a girlfriend and have no interest in starting a relationship with her. she says she understands and just wants to be friends and asks for my number... here's the real f up, i gave the number to her. for the next few weeks i keep just responding to her annoying texts with short 1 word answers hoping she can take a hint when one day i say fk it katie, i'm done talking to you i'm not interested in you. glad i got that off my chest, i go on with my life. a week later im hanging out with my girlfriend and suddenly my phone blows up with picture messages from katie... you can see where this is going, she waited until she knew i was with the gf and started sending me tons of ****. and i'm very open with my phone so i had my girlfriend check the texts for me... needless to say we ended up breaking up because that is pretty compelling evidence of cheating, and now i have this creepy stalker girl who is **** bent on breaking up any relationship i have in hopes i'll turn to her... if only i had declined that friend request... so i got her number blocked so she can't message me any more hopefully she will leave me alone...","girl adds me on facebook, not wanting to be rude after i accept and respond to her messages, end up giving her my number when she asks, and she uses that to break me and my gf up by sending nudes when she knows we are together...",,,2.

0,118,exploration,relationship,tldr,telling a counselor about a friend's suicidal thoughts,24,16,0.8500000238,24,"i never really thought that i could post something like this here until today. so this happened about two years ago, but the effect it had is still a problem today.

i met someone at the beginning of my freshman year, and they almost immediately opened up to me about their dark thoughts. i didn't try to help them myself, because i knew i wouldn't be able to. i listened the best i could, i gave her a hug, and we both went about our day.

later that day, though, i told a school counselor about everything she said. the counselor told me they would call her in soon and ask about suicidal thoughts and try to help her. i thanked them and, although i worried about my friend, i hoped they could get the help they need from the counselor.

the next day, i was talking to my friend. they were upset because they had to go to the counselor, who asked them about suicidal thoughts. she said it was probably because her choir teacher ratted her out. this is probably where my mistake was, but i told her ""actually, that was me.""

this person hates me now. the relationship i had with them got worse and worse. they never did anything nice for me after this, and went out of their way to single me out when we were in the same group for any reason. they have refused to talk to me at all this year. they think i am a truly horrible person because i did this.

other people like them, though. i know they're spreading rumors about me, because other people i know have come to me about falsehoods the person told them about me. i haven't been able to let this go. i don't know what to do.

this happened 6 years ago when i used to work in a banquet hall. i was a bus boy and always tried to help everyone such as the bartenders, chefs and even the dishwashers. 

at our banquet hall, the most popular dinner course we serve is a barbecue dinner menu where the guest can choose to have a steak, chicken or salmon as their main entree. the chicken and salmon are marinated the day before while steak is seasoned on the day of if i can recall correctly. 

one day we had a decent size wedding around 180~ guests and we had roughly 100 orders of steak that night. the chef had just seasoned the steak and needed help putting them in the walk in fridge. i offered to help as i have done this many times before but in smaller quantities.

the steaks are on trays, each holding probably up to 40 steak each. keep in mind each steak is 10 to 12oz. normally i carry one tray at a time and it's light and easy so, **** me stacked all 3 trays and tried to carry it to the fridge. my first attempt was fail as i couldn't even lift the trays, this should have been my warning but nope. i was thinking maybe i'll just slide the trays off the table and into my arms. as soon as the trays were about to come off the table, all the steaks started to fall off, i struggled so hard to lift the tray back onto the table but nope i couldn't do it. it all just happened too fast and the next second all the steaks were on the floor. our dirty kitchen floor... 

all the chefs were looking, each and every one face palming. i felt so bad and didn't know what to do. luckily i sort of had a good relationship with the kitchen crew and the head chef just told me to pick them all up, wash them and redo the seasoning.","thought i could lift, ended up dropping at least 100 steaks onto the floor",,,2.

the girl, let's call her ""hulk,"" left to attend classes at a local community college for her senior year, although she stayed in contact with her old classmates for the first weeks at the beginning of senior year. after a few months, though, and only after i had realized how much of a **** i had been to blow her off so easily and let such a once-in-a-lifetime chance of friendship slip away from me, she faded away from my thoughts and life went back to being a monotonous, empty void. (hurray for reddit!)

a few hours ago, i was logging into a virtual school class in the computer room at my school when, out of nowhere, i felt two arms wrapping around my neck in a weird bear-hug. thinking it was a friend of mine who likes to troll me by making me look powerless in front of others, i followed my instinct and rammed the back of my head into the unseen person's face.

i turned around with a smug smile and then heard, ""ah!"" sort of like peter griffin after falling down the stairs.

****! 

it was hulk, the last person on earth i expected to be behind me at this moment on such a boring, ordinary day.

my initial shock at seeing her turned to embarrassment and revulsion as i helped her find a chair and apologized profusely. she kind of gagged and closed her eyes for a moment, but she was still happy to see me. she had sneaked into school (without a visitor's pass) to greet her friends and some of her old teachers. we had a brief conversation, hugged, and then she waited for a few minutes for her headache to wear away and her senses to return before leaving.",i zinedine zidane'd the girl i have a crush on.,,,3.

0,135,exploration,relationship,tldr,being paranoid,0,2,0.5,0,"surprisingly, this happened today and is not as funny as the other ones.
so, last night i was paranoid about the future. you see, i've been in an online relationship with a lovely lady from canada for a few months, and she had quite an interest in knives. in fact, she said that she wanted to see the ones in the kitchen when she eventually comes here. all i could think about was being with her and...being hurt by her.
i didn't want to break up with her, because we loved each other a lot and i didn't want her to be with another person like her ex (he was very **** and terrified her). so, i said that i wanted to have some time apart from her.
and i was dumb enough to mention the paranoia.
it ended up as a heartbreaking discussion, and i feel utterly devastated. she said she'd never think of harming anyone. my mind said i loved her but my heart had a lot of mixed feelings. i'm going to see what happens tomorrow.

0,136,exploration,relationship,tldr,giving my parents hentai,22,12,0.8700000048,22,"first of all, me and my parents never talked about relationships, girls, the body, ****, protection or similar. which is kinda wierd since i had a girlfriend since i was 14-15 years old. we never been very close and never hugs or say we love eachother and what not, just ""drive safe"" and stuff like that. at most.

it all started a few weeks ago when i went to an asian store to buy chopsticks. i wanted the kind you can use serveral times and not the disposable ones. i found a package with five pair of chopsticks for less than 50 swedish crowns, which is approximatly 6 dollars. i expected to pay at least the double so i bought them. also, the five pairs where painted in individual colours featuring ""japanese motives"" which i thought was kinda nice. i also bough some noodles, coconut water, japanese daifuku cakes etc.

when i arrive home and unpack the chopsticks, i notice there was the five pairs i saw in the store, but at the back of the package there was another set of five pairs looking exactly the same as the ones on the front of the package. i was going to my parents home that weekend so i thought i could give them to my parents since all their chinese chopsticks are crooked from being put in the dishwasher. i like to give away stuff so they are put to good use instead of just laying around, i need at most two pairs for me and my gf to use anyway.

this week i was sitting watching ""orange is the new black"" while eating daifuku with my chopsticks.i used the purpule set which i havent used up until now. when i have the chopsticks really up close to eat my daifuku, i notice that the robe of the japanese women painted on the chopsticks to be open. as i turn the chopstick around i see her full breast is exposed and they even painted the ****. started to feel the shame spreading throughout my body of the scenario of my parents noticing the same **** as i just did on their corresponding pair of chopsticks.","bought japanese chopsticks, bought to many pairs of chopsticks, gave away half to my parents, notice boobs on one of the pairs, realise my parents also have a pair of boob-chopsticks, feel great shame.",,,2.

she didn't say anything and went straight to sleep. next day she didn't even say a good morning to me. i got up, got dressed and went out with a friend. after i returned home she just bombed me with every problem in our relationship. but what sparked the fight was the ""prostitute thing"".

i just said it to tease her and nothing more. i came home to find all my clothes packed and she threw me out of the house.

worst thing is that i'm new to the country and i have no friends so i guess today i'm sleeping to a hotel and start looking for a new place.

wish i could take everything back... but i guess its too late.

0,146,exploration,relationship,tldr,sleeping with my ex and others.,2,2,0.75,2,"first ever post on reddit! be gentle with me...

so my ex and i broke up because she was taking a year travelling and doing charity work. it was a fairly simple and easy break up for both of us. a year later we plan to meet up in spain as we are both in the same area at the same time on vacation. 

it was brilliant. we had a great time together sightseeing etc and it was just like it was before she left... including the ****. we were so eager to get to it not a care for a condom was given. it was at this point which i **** up. 

firstly the **** was so good that i just couldn't hold it in. i was thinking of gordon brown in a desperate attempt to stop the train from leaving the station... to no success. as you can imagine she was not impressed. and so ensued our adventure for the morning after pill. thankfully we found a pharmacy and aforementioned pill no problem. 

so we parted ways again to continue with our separate lives. i went happily back to my nights out with friends, one night stands and **** buddy relationships. 

now comes the second part of this ****. 

i'm dating a girl whom i very much like, thankfully we have not yet had ****! my ex sent me a rather cold, non conversational text ""are you free, can you call me?"" i call her, she tells me about how she went for a std test and has chlamydia... 

a lot of things have become very clear... cloudy ****, burning sensation when urinating and sore testicles. i thought it was just due to my tight boxers. 

so now i have to contact all of my previous partners, some of whom are now in relationships to spread the good news. some of whom have not reacted so favourably to my honesty.","met up with and had sex with my ex on holiday. didn't use a condom, launched one in her and caught chlamydia. had sex (while unknowingly having chlamydia) with a lot of people afterwards and tried to let everyone know but just got verbally abused for being a ""dirty cunt""",,,3.

the date, all in all, went well. watched movies, laughed, talked, made out a little. that was a week ago today, and at the time, i felt like the luckiest guy in the world, using the right words to make sure i wasn't coming on too strong but playing it nicely.

today, i noticed something was off, she wasn't her usual happy self. i tried to inquire what was wrong, but she told me she'd tell me later. apparently, she believes she's been leading me on, and that i care too much, something that she asked me to be sure of before we'd even started going out. at the end of a rather poor explanation of her actions, she told me she wanted to break up. 

so, back to now, i've explained my actions and reasoning, we've agreed what to tell other people who ask what happened and we have broken up.

so a little backstory, i am in my final year of secondary school (high school i guess) so i need to book a place to stay for college as the place i want to study at is pretty far away. campus accommodation booking opened today so i took the day off of school in order to have a chance to book in. not sure if it is similar in other areas but when people try to book into the accommodation through the website, it is prone to crash pretty much instantly. 
so after about an hour of refreshing over and over again, i am finally able to register on the website. perfect, right? well, i decided to go absolutely full **** and got a little excited. so without reading the instructions to the e-mail, i rush back onto the site with the password i need to sign. i proceed to enter my username and the password. it doesn't work, but i just think of it as a mistake because of all the traffic being directed towards the site.

so,being impatient, i continue to put in the same details for the next hour until i realize the place is booked up completely. at this point, i decide to check my e-mail in case they sent me something. i then realize i shouldn't have been entering my e-mail to log in but a separate username that i had missed.

so now because of my own stupidity, i will have to spend a small fortune worth of gas money to get up and down to college..... the mother is not happy.","spent hours entering the wrong details for college accomodation, will have to sell my left nut to pay for gas up and down.",3,3,2.

instead of scrolling down, to hide the title, i forgot and my boss called me in to have a word about some work. so i walked over and spoke to him for about 5 minutes. i returned to my desk and found the **** ceo of the firm looking at my computer screen. i walked over as if nothing was wrong, and said ""morning boss"". no reply from him. i looked at the screen and saw in huge letters today i **** up. i nearly died. my heart started racing. thinking of an excuse, he looked at me, pointed at the title and said ""looks like you did **** today"" and started laughing. he told me to get back to work and be careful next time and don't go on sites like this as he walked away. still in shock that i dodged a bullet, i sat down at my desk and breathed a huge sigh of relief, thinking i'm never going onto reddit at work again. an hour passed, and guess what, i'm on reddit because reddit is love, reddit is life.

we all got entangled in a position where the girl's hand (whom i was attracted to) was adjacent to my right foot and her head was near my groin. i burst out laughing to dismiss the **** vibes of the situation. well, this triggered a reaction in my body which led to my sphincter to open up all valves and let the warm river flow right on her hand. 

after the awkard moment of silence, i pretend to be dumbfounded by the situation and start gazing at the sky. i pretended like i knew nothing about what just happened and i told them i should go to bed as i have work early morning. 

she hasn't said a word to me since that day.

i don't own a car. they are expensive and i've never been able to afford one and for my entire adult life i've been a cyclist/public transport person. 

so a few months ago i had been borrowing a car from a friend and as they had 4 cars already i was just like, 'hey, let me rent this from you, i'll essentially take over payments and all the bells and whistles.' they oblige and for the first few months it worked well. but then i went through a job change so payments were starting to be late and it was becoming a problem and we both understood this. i always paid but it just wasn't always timely. 

this is he real ****. yesterday, i drove to the nearest gas station for a red bull before work and in the rain rear ended another car. this is the first accident i've ever been in while in a car. i've been hit on my bike several times. it's still blurry. but everything flew forward and my first call was to the husband. the second the police. i took pictures for the insurance and in the end received a $170 ticket. (just what i need with all my other money problems) i have a court date to dispute the charges and it's a giant mess. but without much conversation they are taking the car back. i failed them. the circumstances of the accident are mostly out of my control. i hydroplaned after trying to avoid a high school kid who slammed on his brakes right in front of me and i guess that's life. i **** up. the damage to the car i was driving is minimal but i have to pay for it all. something i can't afford.

and this is where the **** starts. i get a text from my wife on my s7. i start writing back and- somehow- i drop my **** phone. it falls on the concrete, and when i pick it back up- the entire protective glass is broken. literally, destroyed.

well, i'm lucky there was even a protective glass. i took it off and, thank goodness, the screen is untouched. no big deal, another one of those is just 10$. i'll get it tomorrow.

0,238,exploration,work,tldr,my professor thinks my bf is abusing me,2,6,0.75,2,"to fully understand the gravity of this **** i must start at the beginning. this is a rough year for me, a lot of my loved ones are dying slowly and painfully (dementia, copd, and cancer). i'm not a very good sad person. when i'm sad i'm easily aggravated, petulant, and have a tendency to lash out at those who try to comfort me, at least at first. my boyfriend, when he is sad, likes to laugh and be distracted. so he makes jokes for me and tries to be close to me. you can imagine how that works out.
it was this week, my grandmother and another loved one are in the hospital. my boyfriend is trying to go along as normal and i'm being grumpy-miss-sad-pants. we are frustrating the living daylights out of each other, and we had an outburst, or two, at school. i'm not really sure which outburst my professor or professors saw. in fact, i don't even really remember what happened during the outburst, they seem so silly now. about a week later i receive a cryptic email from my professor asking if we can have a meeting. i tell my boyfriend and we get excited. we're speculating on what the professor could possibly want. we're so excited that it could be good news. we could use some good, happy news. i get to the professor's office and sit down. suddenly we're talking about their parents' relationship and i'm being given a card for an abuse counselor. 
the bright side could be that people and professors really care at my school. however, i'm not really feeling that bright side. this professor already didn't like my boyfriend and now i'm afraid he'll be undeservedly judged. he is one of the kindest people ever. he never hits me or verbally abuses me. in fact he's the opposite, he's ever considerate of my feelings. we talk through our disagreements and outbursts always. i can't imagine living with anyone else, much less loving anyone else.
naturally, we discussed this, my boyfriend and i. we really respect this professor and some of the other professors who are concerned, so we decided to go to couples counseling for a session to see if we are doing anything wrong. any suggestions? my boyfriend isn't a bad guy and i'm not a victim. how do we fix this?","my prof thinks my bf is an abusive person when he isn't, because i was aggressively sad about things.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

however the reception didn't reciprocate my sense of humour. the brides family all gasped in shock, and the brides mother started crying, just after the bride got up and left. everyone rushed after her, and the brides father told me 'leave this wedding or you'll be feeding through a tube for the next year'. 

my best friend, the groom, then told me his co-worker was named becky, and that his wife had been suspecting them to have an affair (which they weren't), but my joke understandably gave the wrong idea. i left the wedding and after a long discussion they still wed (this is what facebook tells me anyway) my best friend hasn't text me or called in 2 years, and blocked my number.","tried to be funny, almost separated my best friend and his fiancee and lost my best friend",,,,,,,,,,,,,
0,273,exploration,work,tldr,getting drunk and convincing everyone my hybrid subaru didn't need gas to run and forcing my coworkers to push my car to a gas station...,83,18,0.9200000167,83,"so this actually happened friday night. 

i have had my subaru crosstrek hybrid for about 8 months and never before friday night had it crossed my mind to question whether it needed to have gas to run or not.

on the subaru, it has a display where you can tap through different screens that tell you different information about the car such as fuel and oil levels. it also has one that shows the hybrid battery levels. 

that night, i drove a group of coworkers to a going away party and while i was there i had way too much to drink. one of my coworkers (jake) said he would drive us back. on our way back, jake kept saying that the fuel level was very low and the gas mileage was showing as 0 miles left. he started flipping through the screens using controls on steering wheel and the hybrid battery levels came up and i had this drunken epiphany that because it says 0 on gas and the battery level is showing as full then it must be using the hybrid battery to drive and how could i have just now figured this out?!

so jake keeps saying we should stop and get gas... i am **** but adamant with him that we don't need any gas because ""my car's a hybrid! why do you think i bought a hybrid??"" i have no idea why i was so against just stopping and getting gas as we passed several stations by that point. 

needless to say... a few miles later, the car sputters a bit and dies. i don't remember much of what happened next but fortunately it was only a couple hundred yards from a gas station and i just remember sitting in driver seat steering and my other 3 coworkers out pushing the car up to the gas pump. 

thank **** they were such good sports and mostly just laughing and making fun of me but monday morning it was the talk of the office with the phrase ""why do you think i bought a hybrid?""wrote on my office whiteboard.",took a group of coworkers to a party. drank too much. convinced them that hybrids don't need gas as long as the battery level is full. ending up on side of road with my coworkers pushing my car up to a gas pump. laughing stock of the office.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so this morning, he left for work and i was home alone and super hungover.  i don't get along very well pant as is, but when i have a hangover pants aren't even an option.  so i'm walking around pantless and i happen to look at my thigh.  last night came rushing back to me and i start getting **** as **** at that ridiculous photo opp.  there's a round black tick on my inner thigh. ****, ****, ****.  

i started texting him like crazy and he tells me to use a tweezer and remove it like a splinter.  fine, i'm an expert.  i start going at it with the tweezer but thats not working, so (i'm also a self proclaimed surgeon) i start using a nail clipper.. nope, still nothing.  i start using a needle and i'm really ripping at it.  at this point, i'm bleeding, i have a gash in my leg, and the tick is not moving at all.  one last hurrah, i stick the needle in my leg, it jabs through the black mark and comes out the other end.

my girlfriend and i had been having some relationship issues, mostly around the fact she had, at the last possible minute, got cold feet about moving in and didn't move in. i had set it all up with the landlord, signed a new lease, worked out expenses, etc, and when she decided not to move in, well i somewhat resented her for it. 

fastforward a couple of weeks prior to today, my gf and i decided to talk out the issues we were having. i found out all the reasons she didn't want to move in (and a lot of stuff that i need to work on in a relationship) and she found out why i had been stand offish towards her. i mentioned in this talk that i resented her decision not to move in and was harbouring some negative feelings towards her. 

fastforward again to this morning. everything has been going great for the last few weeks since our talk, however my gf has been a bit glum at times. i questioned it this morning, and she told me 'i can't get past the fact you resented me at one stage in our relationship, i've been trying but i can't. i was hoping it would just go away, but it hasn't and i don't know what to do because i can barely sleep at night.' 
what followed was a massive emotional talk about us and tears were shed, we are now basically taking a break for 5 days or so, so she can think about what she wants to do.

i was at work and i was working with a contractor (we'll call him fred) writing an app. fred and i got on pretty well and chatted a lot about stuff outside of work - hobbies, films, games, family etc

at this point, i had been a dad for a couple of years. the memories of how my daughter was at birth and the following years was still fresh in my mind (as they still are - i don't think any dad forgets things like that)

fred's wife had recently given birth to a son and he was proud as could be. recently, in this context, is a couple of months. fred had the ""i'm a new dad"" glow about him and happily described how his son was progressing.

one day, fred said something like ""do you want to see a picture of my son? my wife has just sent me a new photo"" so i, naturally, said ""yes"". a couple of clicks later and he brings the picture up. there on screen was a cute picture of a happy, smiling baby boy with his eyes squeezed tight in laughter. the conversation went something like this:

1,315,exploration,family,tldr,pushing kids on a swing,21,3,1,21,"so like most other **** ups, this happened a very long time ago.  i was in first grade.  this was a private school where **** and jesus take precedent over all else and anything you hear that contradicts that is wrong; a very close knit community school. 
 
we were at recess and i wanted to go on the swings.  unfortunately, we only had four swings and they were all taken.  so, in my **** of genius, i decided to push some of the other kids while they were swinging.  it was the friendly thing to do and once one of them was done, i’d have first dibs on the swing.  

so i’m going back and forth between two kids pushing them when one of the other two kids wanted me to push them.  at this point i was frustrated.  it had already been about ten minutes and i wasn’t planning on pushing kids for the entirety of recess.  i was annoyed that they were acting like i owed it to them to push them.  so, at that moment, to not push them, i said “i can’t push you because black people are bad” – to a black kid, in the first grade, of a school that was predominately white.  i think there was maybe only five black kids in the school.

i’m not sure why i said it.  i was only six, so i don’t believe i actually understood racism.  i also didn’t mean it; it was just what i came up with on the spot.  it was a very bad choice.

after recess the kid tells the teacher what i said and i got scolded by her, the principal, and the guidance counselor for the rest of the day about how what i said was wrong.  they gave me detention for two weeks and made me write an apology letter to the kid and their family.  they told my parents, who grounded me.

for the next few months every student in my class treated me as if i was rudolph or something.  it was not a fun experience. i eventually became friends with the classmate","was pushing kids on swings, didn’t want to push one kid, told them it was because they were black",5,4,,5,4,,,,,,,,

this thanksgiving, after my sister's persuasion, i decided to go to her family's house, since everyone else was going to be going there. i would be there all week, and i didn't want to leave my pet hamster, buddy, alone for the holidays, so i brought him with me all the way up to chilly montana. 

my sister's daughter (who is three) absolutely feel in love with buddy. she'd play with him, feed him, and hug him. she'd even asked me to bring his cage into her room, which i agreed so long as she never took him out unless there was an adult to watch. 

now, a few hours ago, she was put to bed while the rest of the family would be out in the family room, enjoying the later hours of this day of feasting. her room always got cold, and when the girl woke up to use the restroom, she looked over to see my hamster shivering. 

like any three year old with an astute concern for life, she decided it would be a good idea to warm buddy up by throwing him in the microwave. now this would be breaking the one rule i gave her, but she would see it as saving the poor hamster from the freezing temperatures of the house. 

so here i am, in the family room, far from the kitchen, when i hear a ***pop*** followed by a scream. 

the hamster exploded within 42 seconds of putting him in there.

his blood, gore, and fur lined the window, with the bones jutting into the plastic frame of the microwave. 

i've spent to past few hours cleaning up his remains.

i was about 20 years old at the time, and taking driving lessons. i was living with my gf at the time and her family, and her mum had previously been a driving instructor. so, she used to let me get the car out of the garage. however, on this one occasion, gf's mum had parked the car quite wonky. so it took me a lot of gentle acceleration, turn, brake etc. my gf and her mum are meanwhile watching me from just outside the garage. 
i feel i must've mixed up the brake and accelerator, because where i tried to hit the brakes quite firmly as i'd gone quite close to hit the side of the garage, i instead hit the accelerator - the car shot forward, gf and mum have to jump out the way and i hit the garden wall with a lot of impact.

fast forward to last week. my roommate recently got into a committed relationship, just before a super hot and painfully single red-headed young woman started working where he did. he invited her over for me, and i got her number. i set up a date for lunch a few days later.

the date went well, i thought, but it was only today, five days later, that i realized my mistake. my roommate came up during the conversation, so i asked her if she thought he was cute. she told me she doesn't think of coworkers that way. i followed up by agreeing that workplace relationships are usually pretty bad times all around, adding that i had personal experience. she seemed curious, so i elaborated, i told her the whole story.

there was more conversation after that, then i drove her home so she could get to class on time. i haven't heard from her, and i've been racking my brain all weekend trying to figure out why.","so this summer i was involved with a coworker who was using me to get revenge on her husband. i knew it and i was ok with that. she eventually divorced him and we all moved on; i lost that job and found a new one.

well, one of my duties was to wake up every day this week at 5:30 at go get the crew coffee at starbucks. easy enough. well, it got even easier. 

there was an incredibly cute girl working the early morning shifts this week. so everyday this week, i woke up, went to starbucks and flirted with this really nice, cute, smart girl for about 10-15 mins until i had to leave. 

well, yesterday was the last day of the shoot, so really, the last day that i get to see this girl. i decided i would give her my number because thats what i should do right? 

she hands me the coffee for the day and i say, ""today is the last day of the shoot, so i won't be in here again!"" 

frowning, she says, ""well, i don't work this next week, so i won't be in here either.""

got told the usual, ""aww you're so sweet, but my mom would kill me if she figured out i was in a relationship, etc."" 

now i hate optimism.

 

edit: feeling a lot better after some sleep thx for the comments everyone, and no her mom wouldn't actually disown her for dating someone, that was just bullshit to help soften crushing reality. =/",,,1. Not guilty,,,,,,,,,,

so to start things off me and my girlfriend have had a long distance relationship for the last 3 months after i moved half way across the country for school.  during this time we started doing sexy webcam shows for each other which was fun.  


then comes today.  at this point we have done these a few times and all has always ended well, then i decided to up the anti and ask her if she can make herself squirt.


so to clarify something, i use a desktop with a webcam that i can move around and she is using this macbook with a built in camera that i managed to salvage for her a couple of years ago.  this is where we **** up, and in the back of my mind i saw as an issue.  as she starts going at it she says that she doesn't think she will be able to squirt from **** because she never has before, and then as we are reaching the end of our journey all of a sudden she explodes like a geyser while aimed directly at her macbook.


i immediately have an oh **** feeling going on in my mind because i see the trajectory coming just south of the camera.  she is caught up in the moment and asking me if i saw that, and i'm shouting at her to immediately power down her laptop and turn it upside down so the liquid doesn't get to the motherboard.  about 20 seconds later our video call ends and she calls me back on her cell phone.  i ask her if she turned it off when i told her to, to which she responds that the laptop turned off by itself.  well, now we have to wait about 24 hours and hope that the thing turned itself off to save itself instead of because the whole motherboard is fried.","today i fucked up.

now, if you got a dirty mind like me, you thinking the same. i'm 20 at the time so i should know better but i say - ""aha, you don't need sweets - grandpa could help you out with that"".

i've been on a new diet/exercise regime for the last few weeks, and every now and then i get really hungry. i'm obsessively counting calories, so i was scouring the cabinets looking for something low-cal to eat. entire can of marinated jalapenos for only 40 calories? bingo!
so i eat the entire can of jalapenos, and go about my day. two hours later, i'm browsing the internet on the couch when i suddenly realize i must make an immediate sortie to the toilet, as bad things are about to happen.

i pull down my pants just in time to unleash a torrent of pepper oil diarrhea. my stomach is churning, and my **** is on fire. i sit on the john for a while until the pain subsides. as soon as a i stand up, i realize that i've **** not *into* the toilet, but rather all over the back of it. ****. now i suddenly understand how it happens. *now i'm one of those people.*

horrified by the mess all over the toilet and all over my backside, i tip toe out of the bathroom to the cabinet under the sink, and grab a baby wipe in one hand, and a clorox wipe in the other. cue the ****.

absconding back into the bathroom, i promptly forget which wipe was in which hand. the mistake is readily apparent once my **** is ignited into a broiling agony that rivals the deepest pits of ****. shoving a steak knife up my **** would have been a walk in the park compared to this torment.

so, i start screaming and my partner comes running, only to find me clutching my ****-covered butt in a ****-covered bathroom, sobbing. a bit much for a month old relationship...","so this story actually happened yesterday, for what it's worth.

 i find c outside alone crying uncontrollably so obviously ive got to try and settle her down and comfort her. for about ten minutes she cries into my shoulder while im spouting out encouraging words like a cheerleader with tourettes and trying to convince her it wasn't her fault. and its working! she stops crying. were still locked in the hug for about thirty seconds and then she looks up and says ""thank you for being a friend"" and i smile and then i open my **** **** mouth and my brain pretty much sharts all over the inside of my skull and i reply with ""its no ones fault but yours"".

a few hundred dollars later, i have a sander, drop cloth, roller, rustoleum dry erase paint, and i one upped it with magnetic primer, so when all is said and done i can have a magnetic dry erase wall.

so far, so good.

did i mention the shop vac was in the living room and i was in my office?

i start smelling something that's not right.

apparently, the previous owner of said shop vac was the crazy cat lady and she used it to clean her litter boxes.

sophomore year went fine. we were friendly to each other, no animosity towards each other, all went well. until a few months before the end of school. that's when i realized how of an idiot i was. i had fallen in love with her all over again. now a week or so before i realized i was head over heels again, she had told me she was moving to texas. i live in ny so that's quite a distance. we stopped talking again after she moved for a few months. so that's the end of it right?

wrong. later she texts me and we started talking again. so guess what happens. she tells me she still loves me, even after we had been broken up. so queue resurgence of feelings. around mid-may she moves back, and we start talking more seriously. i want to start dating again, she wants us to get to know each other again. i agree and we hang out a few times (**** may have been involved) and we sort of hit it off again. 

then her best friend convinces her i'm evil because i hurt her the first time. she still says she loves me, says she does want to date me again, but she refuses to talk to me, gets mad when i don't and over all has me bending over backwards.

later that day, though, i told a school counselor about everything she said. the counselor told me they would call her in soon and ask about suicidal thoughts and try to help her. i thanked them and, although i worried about my friend, i hoped they could get the help they need from the counselor.

the next day, i was talking to my friend. they were upset because they had to go to the counselor, who asked them about suicidal thoughts. she said it was probably because her choir teacher ratted her out. this is probably where my mistake was, but i told her ""actually, that was me.""

this person hates me now. the relationship i had with them got worse and worse. they never did anything nice for me after this, and went out of their way to single me out when we were in the same group for any reason. they have refused to talk to me at all this year. they think i am a truly horrible person because i did this.

this happened 6 years ago when i used to work in a banquet hall. i was a bus boy and always tried to help everyone such as the bartenders, chefs and even the dishwashers. 

at our banquet hall, the most popular dinner course we serve is a barbecue dinner menu where the guest can choose to have a steak, chicken or salmon as their main entree. the chicken and salmon are marinated the day before while steak is seasoned on the day of if i can recall correctly. 

one day we had a decent size wedding around 180~ guests and we had roughly 100 orders of steak that night. the chef had just seasoned the steak and needed help putting them in the walk in fridge. i offered to help as i have done this many times before but in smaller quantities.

the steaks are on trays, each holding probably up to 40 steak each. keep in mind each steak is 10 to 12oz. normally i carry one tray at a time and it's light and easy so, **** me stacked all 3 trays and tried to carry it to the fridge. my first attempt was fail as i couldn't even lift the trays, this should have been my warning but nope. i was thinking maybe i'll just slide the trays off the table and into my arms. as soon as the trays were about to come off the table, all the steaks started to fall off, i struggled so hard to lift the tray back onto the table but nope i couldn't do it. it all just happened too fast and the next second all the steaks were on the floor. our dirty kitchen floor... 

all the chefs were looking, each and every one face palming. i felt so bad and didn't know what to do. luckily i sort of had a good relationship with the kitchen crew and the head chef just told me to pick them all up, wash them and redo the seasoning.","before i start, apologies for the formatting, first time posting on this subreddit :)

one day we had a decent size wedding around 180~ guests and we had roughly 100 orders of steak that night. the chef had just seasoned the steak and needed help putting them in the walk in fridge. i offered to help as i have done this many times before but in smaller quantities.

the steaks are on trays, each holding probably up to 40 steak each. keep in mind each steak is 10 to 12oz. normally i carry one tray at a time and it's light and easy so, stupid me stacked all 3 trays and tried to carry it to the fridge. my first attempt was fail as i couldn't even lift the trays, this should have been my warning but nope. i was thinking maybe i'll just slide the trays off the table and into my arms. as soon as the trays were about to come off the table, all the steaks started to fall off, i struggled so hard to lift the tray back onto the table but nope i couldn't do it. it all just happened too fast and the next second all the steaks were on the floor. our dirty kitchen floor... 

all the chefs were looking, each and every one face palming. i felt so bad and didn't know what to do. luckily i sort of had a good relationship with the kitchen crew and the head chef just told me to pick them all up, wash them and redo the seasoning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

a few hours ago, i was logging into a virtual school class in the computer room at my school when, out of nowhere, i felt two arms wrapping around my neck in a weird bear-hug. thinking it was a friend of mine who likes to troll me by making me look powerless in front of others, i followed my instinct and rammed the back of my head into the unseen person's face.

i turned around with a smug smile and then heard, ""ah!"" sort of like peter griffin after falling down the stairs.

****! 

it was hulk, the last person on earth i expected to be behind me at this moment on such a boring, ordinary day.

my initial shock at seeing her turned to embarrassment and revulsion as i helped her find a chair and apologized profusely. she kind of gagged and closed her eyes for a moment, but she was still happy to see me. she had sneaked into school (without a visitor's pass) to greet her friends and some of her old teachers. we had a brief conversation, hugged, and then she waited for a few minutes for her headache to wear away and her senses to return before leaving.","i'm a high school senior. in junior year, as i struggled with the workload of ap/ib classes that i probably shouldn't have been in, i knew a beautiful redhead who kept trying to befriend me. being the permavirgin workhorse that i am, i was too distracted to realize some of the obvious signs. only when it was too late did i commence cyber-stalking her and fantasizing about a relationship.

so, last night i was paranoid about the future. you see, i've been in an online relationship with a lovely lady from canada for a few months, and she had quite an interest in knives. in fact, she said that she wanted to see the ones in the kitchen when she eventually comes here. all i could think about was being with her and...being hurt by her.
i didn't want to break up with her, because we loved each other a lot and i didn't want her to be with another person like her ex (he was very **** and terrified her). so, i said that i wanted to have some time apart from her.
and i was dumb enough to mention the paranoia.
it ended up as a heartbreaking discussion, and i feel utterly devastated. she said she'd never think of harming anyone. my mind said i loved her but my heart had a lot of mixed feelings. i'm going to see what happens tomorrow.

 

edit: we talked things out, and we promised never to speak of it again. it was...pretty scary.","surprisingly, this happened today and is not as funny as the other ones.

she didn't say anything and went straight to sleep. next day she didn't even say a good morning to me. i got up, got dressed and went out with a friend. after i returned home she just bombed me with every problem in our relationship. but what sparked the fight was the ""prostitute thing"".

i just said it to tease her and nothing more. i came home to find all my clothes packed and she threw me out of the house.

worst thing is that i'm new to the country and i have no friends so i guess today i'm sleeping to a hotel and start looking for a new place.

so my ex and i broke up because she was taking a year travelling and doing charity work. it was a fairly simple and easy break up for both of us. a year later we plan to meet up in spain as we are both in the same area at the same time on vacation. 

it was brilliant. we had a great time together sightseeing etc and it was just like it was before she left... including the ****. we were so eager to get to it not a care for a condom was given. it was at this point which i **** up. 

firstly the **** was so good that i just couldn't hold it in. i was thinking of gordon brown in a desperate attempt to stop the train from leaving the station... to no success. as you can imagine she was not impressed. and so ensued our adventure for the morning after pill. thankfully we found a pharmacy and aforementioned pill no problem. 

so we parted ways again to continue with our separate lives. i went happily back to my nights out with friends, one night stands and **** buddy relationships. 

now comes the second part of this ****. 

i'm dating a girl whom i very much like, thankfully we have not yet had ****! my ex sent me a rather cold, non conversational text ""are you free, can you call me?"" i call her, she tells me about how she went for a std test and has chlamydia... 

a lot of things have become very clear... cloudy ****, burning sensation when urinating and sore testicles. i thought it was just due to my tight boxers. 

so now i have to contact all of my previous partners, some of whom are now in relationships to spread the good news. some of whom have not reacted so favourably to my honesty.","first ever post on reddit! be gentle with me...

0,627,exploration,work,documents,leaving tifu on my screen at work,5232,396,0.9100000262,5232,"so this happened a few hours ago.

backstory: i work in a small industry firm, with no more than 10 employees, in the finance department, so going on reddit is fine since there's no customers come in or out of the office.

everyday i come to work and most days, i'm always on reddit to pass time if there's no work to do. i usually go on the popular, main subreddits including tifu. when i go on tifu, i usually scroll down to hide the title today i **** up (since its obviously inappropriate at work). but today was different. today, i was a ****.

instead of scrolling down, to hide the title, i forgot and my boss called me in to have a word about some work. so i walked over and spoke to him for about 5 minutes. i returned to my desk and found the **** ceo of the firm looking at my computer screen. i walked over as if nothing was wrong, and said ""morning boss"". no reply from him. i looked at the screen and saw in huge letters today i **** up. i nearly died. my heart started racing. thinking of an excuse, he looked at me, pointed at the title and said ""looks like you did **** today"" and started laughing. he told me to get back to work and be careful next time and don't go on sites like this as he walked away. still in shock that i dodged a bullet, i sat down at my desk and breathed a huge sigh of relief, thinking i'm never going onto reddit at work again. an hour passed, and guess what, i'm on reddit because reddit is love, reddit is life.

 

**edit;** woah, this blew up! thank you for the gold <3 looking at your replies, most of you saying to lock my computer when leaving my desk, good idea, next time ;)
and no, the ceo isn't any of you guys!... or is it... hey boss xd","so this happened a few hours ago.

i had a whole army of ants at my disposal and they were doign a great job of keeping my room clean. i would drop crumbs all over the place after snacking in front of my computer, go to bed, and wake up with them all gone. i was pretty satisfied with their work, and made no effort to get rid of them, they became my cleaning minions. 

several days ago, i started noticing that they had started working on cleaning my keyboard, ants were streaming in and out from under the keys (i have a mechanical keyboard), and i was really happy about it. it's going to be spotless under there! i paid no attention to them, and let them carry on with the good work.

this went on for a while, and my keyboard must of been really dirty because they continued working on it not stop. the **** happened today when one my keys got kind of stuck, and when i pressed it, a swarm of ants came out from underneath. i pulled off the key and looked underneath to find that in fact, they hadn't been cleaning my keyboard by hauling stuff out of there, they were using it to build a freaking nest! it was chock full of ants and saw-dust looking debris tightly packed into every crevice. i spent half the day taking my keyboard apart and cleaning it, dispersing a swarm of several hundred ants that made it their home. luckily, keyboard still works fine.","so, i'm very lazy when it comes to cleaning my room and about 2 weeks ago, i notice a bunch of ants have started to make a home somewhere in the walls. they were very small ants, and apart from being bitten once in a while (not that painful), i didn't mind them at all for the fact that every time i dropped crumbs and other food stuff i couldn't be bothered to clean up, i noticed that given a bit of time, my ants would clean it up for me. sweet!

they slow down and i hear a ""stop staring at me through your #*cking sunglasses you creep!"" and then they speed away yelling more obscenities at me.  

it takes me a few seconds of thinking ""wtf was that about"" to realize that my head was tilted down while i was txting on the other side of my car, and the car was blocking my phone.  my sunglasses were lined up like they would be if they were on my face and i was looking up.  it looked like i was just some creep standing in the bushes with sunglasses on staring at a car full of women for a long time, and that i tried to approach their car as they drove away.

i don't own a car. they are expensive and i've never been able to afford one and for my entire adult life i've been a cyclist/public transport person. 

so a few months ago i had been borrowing a car from a friend and as they had 4 cars already i was just like, 'hey, let me rent this from you, i'll essentially take over payments and all the bells and whistles.' they oblige and for the first few months it worked well. but then i went through a job change so payments were starting to be late and it was becoming a problem and we both understood this. i always paid but it just wasn't always timely. 

this is he real ****. yesterday, i drove to the nearest gas station for a red bull before work and in the rain rear ended another car. this is the first accident i've ever been in while in a car. i've been hit on my bike several times. it's still blurry. but everything flew forward and my first call was to the husband. the second the police. i took pictures for the insurance and in the end received a $170 ticket. (just what i need with all my other money problems) i have a court date to dispute the charges and it's a giant mess. but without much conversation they are taking the car back. i failed them. the circumstances of the accident are mostly out of my control. i hydroplaned after trying to avoid a high school kid who slammed on his brakes right in front of me and i guess that's life. i **** up. the damage to the car i was driving is minimal but i have to pay for it all. something i can't afford. 

i spent all night in emotional agony. they are good friends of mine and probably 2 of maybe 3 total and i'm losing them. today i **** up. today i'm losing two of the best friends i've ever had.","so this is an on going story by the real shit happened yesterday.

i always carry 2 phones with me. my galaxy j5 (my work number) and my galaxy s7 (personal). 

so, yesterday, there was a big concert in my city. i went out with my friends- which i rarely do, since all of us are busy during the week. we stayed 'till maybe 11pm or so. we were going home.

and this is where the **** starts. i get a text from my wife on my s7. i start writing back and- somehow- i drop my **** phone. it falls on the concrete, and when i pick it back up- the entire protective glass is broken. literally, destroyed.

well, i'm lucky there was even a protective glass. i took it off and, thank goodness, the screen is untouched. no big deal, another one of those is just 10$. i'll get it tomorrow.

well, i'm back home. it is like 1am already and i'm tired and **** as ****. the place where i put my phone (when charging it) is a little sort of stand- which is *really* small, just barely big enough for a lamp to stand there and my phone to be charged there. well, i never had problems with this, since i always simply turn off my sound. but, for some reason, the smart person that i am, i decide to leave it on *vibrate*. i fall asleep quickly, not realising what i had done.


today, 11am, i wake up. i look around, and see... my **** phone on the ground. it had like, 12 notifications from stuff like discord, some games my son installed, and other ****. keep in mind, now my phone has no protection, just bare glass. i assume it just vibrated its way down.

the worst part...

my entire screen is broken. there is *a lot* of cracks on it. a shitton. i can't even use it normally. i'll have to pay an entire new screen today- and honestly it isn't cheap either, 50$ is some decent money.","this just happened, maybe 1h ago as i'm writing this.

0,688,exploration,work,documents,my professor thinks my bf is abusing me,2,6,0.75,2,"to fully understand the gravity of this **** i must start at the beginning. this is a rough year for me, a lot of my loved ones are dying slowly and painfully (dementia, copd, and cancer). i'm not a very good sad person. when i'm sad i'm easily aggravated, petulant, and have a tendency to lash out at those who try to comfort me, at least at first. my boyfriend, when he is sad, likes to laugh and be distracted. so he makes jokes for me and tries to be close to me. you can imagine how that works out.
it was this week, my grandmother and another loved one are in the hospital. my boyfriend is trying to go along as normal and i'm being grumpy-miss-sad-pants. we are frustrating the living daylights out of each other, and we had an outburst, or two, at school. i'm not really sure which outburst my professor or professors saw. in fact, i don't even really remember what happened during the outburst, they seem so silly now. about a week later i receive a cryptic email from my professor asking if we can have a meeting. i tell my boyfriend and we get excited. we're speculating on what the professor could possibly want. we're so excited that it could be good news. we could use some good, happy news. i get to the professor's office and sit down. suddenly we're talking about their parents' relationship and i'm being given a card for an abuse counselor. 
the bright side could be that people and professors really care at my school. however, i'm not really feeling that bright side. this professor already didn't like my boyfriend and now i'm afraid he'll be undeservedly judged. he is one of the kindest people ever. he never hits me or verbally abuses me. in fact he's the opposite, he's ever considerate of my feelings. we talk through our disagreements and outbursts always. i can't imagine living with anyone else, much less loving anyone else.
naturally, we discussed this, my boyfriend and i. we really respect this professor and some of the other professors who are concerned, so we decided to go to couples counseling for a session to see if we are doing anything wrong. any suggestions? my boyfriend isn't a bad guy and i'm not a victim. how do we fix this?","to fully understand the gravity of this fuck up i must start at the beginning. this is a rough year for me, a lot of my loved ones are dying slowly and painfully (dementia, copd, and cancer). i'm not a very good sad person. when i'm sad i'm easily aggravated, petulant, and have a tendency to lash out at those who try to comfort me, at least at first. my boyfriend, when he is sad, likes to laugh and be distracted. so he makes jokes for me and tries to be close to me. you can imagine how that works out.

first of all, had some doubts about posting it here. i really could use some sound advice but i've read some of the best advice here, even more then on r/advice

a bit of background info: when i watch ****, i like search for amateur stuff. one ""good"" source are websites prostitutes use to advertise themselves. you can see some nice pics of real amateur girls that way.
i know, it's a bit freaky, but i like it.

so one day i'm browsing facebook and i come across a post of the girlfriend of my girlfriend's sister. she has posted a pic with her aunt, who looks strangely familiar.. i couldn't place her face but some where in the back of my mind it seemed like i met her some where.

fast forward a week or two. my girlfriend has the night shift, i'm home alone and since we're seeing that much of each other during that week, i'm having some private time. again i go looking for some nice ""real amateurs"" (or should i call them pros?). i'm having a good time when i open a page and stare in to the eyes of the aunt i mentioned before.

so, ok my sister in law's girlfriend aunt is a ****. since i don't know the woman, i don't really care. i started to get curious and googled around for a bit. i came across a dutch forum, which contains reviews of working girls. being for too nosy for my own good i start reading reviews of (let's call her) ellen. while going through them, i read about ellen's younger friend, sandra. 

sandra's description fits perfectly with that of my sister in law's girlfriend... i search the forum for sandra and find a topic discussing her. (by now fun time was totally over btw, totally covered myself up and all). there's a link to an ad, but it's offline. 

eventually i do the stupiest move and take a pic of sandra of facebook and send it to one of the reviewers. i say i'm interested in her, but can't find an ad anymore. i also mention i got the pic through ellen. the guy believes me and confirms that she the girl he met and payed for ****.","hi,

this day was a day like any other except my iphone was a little low on batteries. my mom has a nifty little iphone charging chord dangling from her, work assigned, macbook so i just go ahead as plug my phone into her computer. the computer does it's thing and asks if i want to download all i my pictures, and music, and get all of the updates that i haven't gotten in the last ten years and my mom just sort of flips it around with a sigh so i can push all the buttons i want to push because at this time in our lives, as well as now, i was better a tech than her. 

 
remembering that i've got my unprofessional personal photos on my phone i request to not upload any pictures or music, and just to be safe dont update my phone. and that was the end of it, or so i thought. 


dun dun dduuunnn!



i get a call a few days later from my mom ""professor! you left nudes on my comp!"" so i rush to her office to see what the hell happened and find that she had a second program, this was a few years ago so i don't remember what it was, that didn't ask if you waned your photos uploaded, it just assumed you wanted it.

to add a little context, i am studying abroad for the semester in europe and just moved into my new apartment with 4 other guys i don't know. this is the first week so we all decided to go out to the biggest club before school starts. i end up picking a girl up at the club that is visiting on vacation that is leaving the next day and take her back to the apartment. 

sexy time ensues and after the first round i realize she is pretty **** and is up for whatever. having never done butt stuff before and realizing i will probably never see the girl ever again after the night, i accept her offer to do ****. 

now for the fu... i am not sure what to do at this point, so i just begin to finger her **** and see where it goes from there. everything seems to be going ok as she is getting into it and moaning. so i pull my fingers out and am excited to finally learn what all the fuss is about and go in... until i look down and see a sizable black blob on my new white sheets. still in a drunken haze from the club, all i can say is, ""what is that?"" and slowly get off the bed. she immediately gives a shriek, jumps off the bed, and runs to the bathroom. at this point, my new roommates wake up and ask me what the **** happened. all i can do is stare at the **** i scooped out of her **** and lament my freudian desire to try and enter that mysterious 3rd dimension. when i finally work up the courage to enter the bathroom and confront her, i find her crying on the bathroom floor, totally mortified. all i can think to say in my numb state to console her is, ""shit happens."" she gives me a blank stare, gets up, puts on her clothes, and leaves without saying another word and i throw all the linens in the washing machine. 

needless to say, there was a very awkward conversation with my roommates the next day.

0,723,exploration,work,documents,getting drunk and convincing everyone my hybrid subaru didn't need gas to run and forcing my coworkers to push my car to a gas station...,83,18,0.9200000167,83,"so this actually happened friday night. 

i have had my subaru crosstrek hybrid for about 8 months and never before friday night had it crossed my mind to question whether it needed to have gas to run or not.

on the subaru, it has a display where you can tap through different screens that tell you different information about the car such as fuel and oil levels. it also has one that shows the hybrid battery levels. 

that night, i drove a group of coworkers to a going away party and while i was there i had way too much to drink. one of my coworkers (jake) said he would drive us back. on our way back, jake kept saying that the fuel level was very low and the gas mileage was showing as 0 miles left. he started flipping through the screens using controls on steering wheel and the hybrid battery levels came up and i had this drunken epiphany that because it says 0 on gas and the battery level is showing as full then it must be using the hybrid battery to drive and how could i have just now figured this out?!

so jake keeps saying we should stop and get gas... i am **** but adamant with him that we don't need any gas because ""my car's a hybrid! why do you think i bought a hybrid??"" i have no idea why i was so against just stopping and getting gas as we passed several stations by that point. 

needless to say... a few miles later, the car sputters a bit and dies. i don't remember much of what happened next but fortunately it was only a couple hundred yards from a gas station and i just remember sitting in driver seat steering and my other 3 coworkers out pushing the car up to the gas pump. 

thank **** they were such good sports and mostly just laughing and making fun of me but monday morning it was the talk of the office with the phrase ""why do you think i bought a hybrid?""wrote on my office whiteboard.","so this actually happened friday night.

so this morning, he left for work and i was home alone and super hungover.  i don't get along very well pant as is, but when i have a hangover pants aren't even an option.  so i'm walking around pantless and i happen to look at my thigh.  last night came rushing back to me and i start getting **** as **** at that ridiculous photo opp.  there's a round black tick on my inner thigh. ****, ****, ****.  

i started texting him like crazy and he tells me to use a tweezer and remove it like a splinter.  fine, i'm an expert.  i start going at it with the tweezer but thats not working, so (i'm also a self proclaimed surgeon) i start using a nail clipper.. nope, still nothing.  i start using a needle and i'm really ripping at it.  at this point, i'm bleeding, i have a gash in my leg, and the tick is not moving at all.  one last hurrah, i stick the needle in my leg, it jabs through the black mark and comes out the other end.

my girlfriend and i had been having some relationship issues, mostly around the fact she had, at the last possible minute, got cold feet about moving in and didn't move in. i had set it all up with the landlord, signed a new lease, worked out expenses, etc, and when she decided not to move in, well i somewhat resented her for it. 

fastforward a couple of weeks prior to today, my gf and i decided to talk out the issues we were having. i found out all the reasons she didn't want to move in (and a lot of stuff that i need to work on in a relationship) and she found out why i had been stand offish towards her. i mentioned in this talk that i resented her decision not to move in and was harbouring some negative feelings towards her. 

fastforward again to this morning. everything has been going great for the last few weeks since our talk, however my gf has been a bit glum at times. i questioned it this morning, and she told me 'i can't get past the fact you resented me at one stage in our relationship, i've been trying but i can't. i was hoping it would just go away, but it hasn't and i don't know what to do because i can barely sleep at night.' 
what followed was a massive emotional talk about us and tears were shed, we are now basically taking a break for 5 days or so, so she can think about what she wants to do.

i’m not sure why i said it.  i was only six, so i don’t believe i actually understood racism.  i also didn’t mean it; it was just what i came up with on the spot.  it was a very bad choice.

my sister's daughter (who is three) absolutely feel in love with buddy. she'd play with him, feed him, and hug him. she'd even asked me to bring his cage into her room, which i agreed so long as she never took him out unless there was an adult to watch. 

now, a few hours ago, she was put to bed while the rest of the family would be out in the family room, enjoying the later hours of this day of feasting. her room always got cold, and when the girl woke up to use the restroom, she looked over to see my hamster shivering. 

like any three year old with an astute concern for life, she decided it would be a good idea to warm buddy up by throwing him in the microwave. now this would be breaking the one rule i gave her, but she would see it as saving the poor hamster from the freezing temperatures of the house.

the hamster exploded within 42 seconds of putting him in there.

his blood, gore, and fur lined the window, with the bones jutting into the plastic frame of the microwave.

i feel i must've mixed up the brake and accelerator, because where i tried to hit the brakes quite firmly as i'd gone quite close to hit the side of the garage, i instead hit the accelerator - the car shot forward, gf and mum have to jump out the way and i hit the garden wall with a lot of impact.
i immediately jump out of the car and apologise profusely while gf's mum stands there in shock, hand covering mouth. eventually i just cry ""please just yell at me, i'm so sorry!"" she never did yell at me though, and just burst out laughing.","ok, so this happened a few years ago, but i still can't forget about it.

,1,part3,relationship,tldr,telling a client that she was involved in a scam,24,5,0.8899999857,24,"so basically i was in my dad's small business store selling business supplies.

our clients are typically small - mid sized businesses and we typically deal with just one purchaser or owner on one end and we have a friendly relationship with our customers. 

so we have this one client [fairly new], who talks alot. she seems really nice and is plenty satisfied with the purchases/prices. 

so anyone, one day she comes into the store [this is random, because we usually just ship it to them].

at this point, my dad is manning the register while i am stocking up the shelves. 

and she tells us about a ""business"" in which you log on to a website, do nothing of note for a few mins each day, provide your personal details, and basically you collect points and you will be rewarded based upon the points. apparently she had been doing this for a month+ now and just needed to log on for another month before collecting a huge reward.

she was going to link us up where we sign up which will give her a bonus 100 points. my dad stated that this was interesting and she should send us a link. 

at this point i blurted out that this was a scam. 

she looked at me like i had engaged in ethnic cleansing, and then starts arguing with me, at which point i state the obvious facts, and why this is clearly a scam, all the while my dad is motioning for me to shut up.

,3,part3,relationship,tldr,lasting longer than the dude...,32,53,0.6499999762,32,"so this story starts a few weeks ago... this super attractive guy (let's call him mark), and i started talking. ya know, casual stuff. not much going on. one night, i got **** and started texting him that i thought he was attractive. ever since then, he started talking to me more and more. slowly, the conversation got more and more... 'interesting.' 

he started telling me how much he wanted me, and we started making plans to see each other. a few nights ago, he picks me up from my house in a ford explorer and we drive out onto a backroad. we climb in the back, and the clothes come off. we're making out, feeling each other up. 

i'll add that i recently got out of a long term relationship, and this was my first encounter with a guy since the breakup. i was looking forward to blowing off some steam. i was a lioness on the prowl for some meat. 

after minimal foreplay, i start to ride him. easy pace, nothing too intense. got to have room to grow, ya know? not even 20 seconds in, his eyes get wide and he looks at me.

""uhm, i think you should stop.""

i look at him, seriously confused and very disappointed. was i really that terrible? i just sit there on top of him for another 2 seconds, trying to figure out what's going on. he looks at me again...

""uh... i'm finished...""

he **** came after 20 seconds. and he didn't even bother to help me finish afterwards. i'm ****, i really had pent up emotions to get rid of.

we stop, put our clothes on, and he silently drives me home. tells me goodnight, i get out of the truck, and walk back into my house. 

and to make matters worse? he still hasn't texted me many days later. ****. i'm disappointed.","fucked a guy, he came way too soon, now things are just super awkward and unfinished, other than him. he finished... too early.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

my girlfriend is freaking out at me right now because i changed my relationship status on facebook to single. yesterday she pretty much dumped me saying she can't do this anymore because she is stressed out over going to college and leaving our city. she doesn't think she can do long distance. plus some stuff about her ex and whatnot. the relationship was coming to an end anyways. but it seemed like a nice soft break up with no hard feelings, so i was okay.


my **** was assuming that she dumped me when she really meant she needs time to think if it really is over between us. so i ended up changing my relationship status on facebook after seeing on hers that it said ""no relationship information"". she is now freaking out, saying ""i'd never dump someone over text, thanks for thinking so highly of me"".

i used to be in a long-distance relationship. i would only see my now-ex girlfriend in person every few months so, when we were able to be together in person, we would take advantage of the situation, so to speak...

she was visiting me and we were, as always, planning to have **** (i'll just be blunt about it.) we're seniors in high school so, of course, i live with my parents and plans have to be made accordingly to conceal our activities (my mother had told me explicitly not to have **** with my girlfriend.) and we were fairly good at this. but there was a problem. she was out of birth control pills.

we had her prescription transferred to my local walmart from hers and picked it up. no big deal. we then went about our activities unencumbered .

after my girlfriend went home my mother showed me a piece of paper one day and asked ""does [insert girlfriend name here] need this?"" in a suspicious tone. to my horror it was the receipt for her birth control pills. we left it in the car. actually, i left it in the car. this isn't today we **** up. it's today i **** up. i made up some **** excuse for her needing them because she was on her period. but my mother, being a woman, saw through the facade.","my mother, not knowing i had lost my virginity, found the receipt to my ex-girlfriend's birth control prescription in the family car.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

after making the dip and rigorously washing our hands, we went to play some video games. about 30 minutes later, she was holding the eye of sauron. the most intense burning set in and we were desperate. ice, milk, aloe - all the fixes were temporary relief and nothing alleviated the burn. i had heard **** had the benefit of providing relief and suggested it. she is a trooper and was desperate for a relief, so she allowed me to **** on her hands. it actually worked! or maybe it was mental...

que about 30 minutes later, her lips are burning (she likely touched them later in the chopping process). again, i offered up my services, and for the first time in our relationship, i delivered cool frosting relief direct to her face.

while it did alleviate her burn (though she said it was the most disgusting thing she had ever done), i wasn't as careful this time and picked up some of the oils.

i had never had a jalapeno burn before, but experiencing it on tiny tim has to be the worst way to go. unfortunately, weapon of **** destruction was already deployed twice the in proceeding hour, thus had none left to offer. i then proceeded to kneel before the tub faucet for the next hour running cool water, which she thought was the perfect time to immortalize on her phone forever.","convinced gf to allow me to cum on her face to alleviate burn, got jalapeno dick",,,,,,,,,,,,,

the meal goes well and everyone starts to migrate to the living room to digest the unholy amount of poultry we just ate.
my uncle go himself a shield tv and a big **** nas for christmas. the whole thing is perfectly configured with this media center app called kodi. this sweet piece of software allows you to access your music/movies/pictures with a nice slicky interface. 

despite being more than 80, granny is actually quite interested by high tech stuff (especially when it's related to the tv) and she asks me to show her what it does. after a few minutes demonstrating things like netflix and games i show her kodi, and then let her play with the app, navigating movies and whatnot. i then got to the other side of the room to get a drink when when the tv starts blasting **** **** loudly. to add insult to injury, this is not a regular **** but a nice homemade video of my uncle, his boyfriend and another couple. it only took a few seconds to shut down the but the mood was quite ackward for the rest of the day.

because of this, i've developed a bit of a crush on him. he's super nice and selfless, and not terrible looking. he came out to me about a month ago, telling me he thinks he's **** and asking advice, and that only strengthened my desires for him. 

it's now winter break and i haven't seen him in a week. we've kept in casual conversation, nothing too heavy. i've told my home friends of my feelings for him, so the other day i snapchatted a picture of his facebook profile picture to a few friends with the caption ""how could you not fall for this cutie?""

i accidentally sent it to my roommate as well. 

i quickly realized my mistake and proceeded to attempt to cover my **** by sending him more snapchats, zooming in on his face and saying creepier things about him, finally ending with a shot of just his eyes and the caption ""he's watching you."" 

he texted me with a screenshot of all the notifications saying ""u good bro?"" ""hahahaha"" and i replied with ""yeah idek."" luckily, we're both a little eccentric and i hoped he wouldn't think twice about it. we proceeded to have a pretty serious (but short) conversation, and we've talked a few times since then. 

i still can't tell if he caught on or not. 

my biggest fear is that he'll get weirded out because i like him and live with him and that our friendship will suffer. i'm currently leaning towards not pursuing a relationship with him (because we're roommates and that might complicate things), but i'd still like to maintain the good friendship we developed.","i accidentally sent my roommate, who i have feelings for, a snapchat saying that i have feelings for him, and i'm still not sure his reaction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

,16,part3,relationship,tldr,catching the garter at my friend's wedding,16,3,0.8999999762,16,"this happened last weekend. first post.

 
i've been dating my girlfriend for 7 years now and for those of you who are (or have been) at that dating stage, you start to get a lot of the ""when are you getting married"" questions. constantly. especially at weddings.

 
side note: my friend's husband's brother jack (long relationship explanation, i know), who is also the best man, was in an accident a couple years back that left him paralyzed from the waist down. his family has taken care of him since the accident, and as you can imagine it has been quite a transition and a blow to the family.

 
anyway, we're having a good time and partying like you do at a wedding when they call the bouquet and garter tosses. for those of you who may not know, any female not married usually goes out on the floor to catch the bouquet and if they do they're supposed to get married next. it is the same for men with the garter toss. my girlfriend doesn't catch it and everyone gives her **** because we've been dating so long.

 
now it's the men's turn. no **** around. i'm going out there, and i am not leaving without the garter. i don't know why it seemed like it was such a big deal at the time, but i really wanted to get it. for the sake of chivalry? possible. some deep-seeded issue with my self confidence that i thought catching a sweaty garter would fix? probable.

 
all the dudes line up and the groom fires the garter in the air. it's headed slightly right. i have to lean slightly... boom! i caught that ****. i felt like the man...

 
until i look behind me. and lock eyes with the groom's parapalygic brother jack. and realize the garter would have fallen in his lap, and to everyone else it looked like i intercepted the garter from the wheelchair-bound best man at the last second.

 
i am pretty sure i will never be able to look at my friend's husband fred or his brother jack ever, and will cringe until the day i die thinking back on this night... the night i stole from a dude in a wheelchair.",intercepted the garter from the parapalygic best man at a friend's wedding,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my day started well, favorite breakfast, lunch at the street corner on my work, and dinner with friends and family. now as i lay in my bed, my phone beeps for an alarm for my birthday with a letter attachment to it. i wrote myself a letter last year of the things i should do, adventures i should take, lessons i need to learn etc. as i go through the letter i can’t help but notice that i almost accomplished all of those things on the letter.  except for my biggest fu.

i told myself to stop dating different girl every month and just focus on one. and i did. i met her, and with her i am me, no holding back, no lies, not pretending, i am just me. last year was an amazing year because i have her. then i fu. i broke up with her because i got cold feet and i thought we were going too fast and we are going serious too soon. 

now that it is my birthday, i never felt alone. yes, i have my family but i have an estranged relationship with all of them. i have my friends who i met through games but i they never understand the real me. i had her, nothing else matter except her but i lost her because my 25 year old me broke up with her one sunny wednesday thinking it is the right thing to do. of course the player in me, ignore all her calls, and texts, and never answer the door to even just talk. 

if i could go back to fall of last year, i would kick myself in the balls, or i would even touch habanero peppers then remove my contacts and **** without even washing my hands to learn my lesson. 

i never felt so alone, so on my birthday, i hope you guys learn from my lesson. it’s ok to be afraid, to get scared, to feel overwhelmed, because of the end of the day, you have that someone and the feeling being loved is the greatest feeling of all.

,19,part3,relationship,tldr,buying flowers,3,2,0.7099999785,3,"so this happened over the course of yesterday to this morning. a little backstory to offer some explanation to this fu. recently i've been trying to get back with my ex (we'll call her sam) with whom i broke up with in july 2015. the reasons in a nutshell why we broke up were my fault, because i lead myself to thinking that she was the reason for me being unhappy. this wasn't the case as i was the one who was not being communicative in the relationship and she was willing to work things out till the end.

anyways fast forward to new years this year. we find me and her out for dinner because i still cared about her and had no other plans that night. we see a movie, and head back home to my place, things go to fourth base from there. anyways the entire month of january i've spent contemplating how much i miss her, and need her in my life. so fast forward again  to this past week. she asks if she should move on forever or if she should wait for me. i tell her to move on and be happy cause i'm not sure yet. saturday comes, she tells me she has a boyfriend as i'm about to confess my feelings for her (somewhat of a fu on my part there).

things get emotional, and we talk and cry as former lovers do. we come to yestersay,  with her having to pick between him and me, i decided to head to her house to convince her. before i get there, i decided to buy some flowers. however, never having ordered professional flowers, i asked the lady at the counter for the presentation package, thinking that it was your typical bouquet. this was the fanciest damned flowers i've ever laid eyes on. the kind of flowers that you buy your wife after a big fu. it's those kind of flowers.

so comes time to pay (they took half an hour to assemble said flowers). the lady tells me ""alright that will be $78.39 sir"". me, thinking i could use these beautiful roses to win the love of my life back says,  ""sure!"". i'm sitting here this morning, still single and heartbroken.",- bought flowers to win back ex. paid 3x amount of flowers that i expected. ex is still ex.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i had been in a weekend relationship since february. my now ex girlfriend lives some 130 km (80 miles) away, so we visited each other each friday to sunday. she came here two weeks ago, so i changed the bedsheets on thursday. i hadn't used those sheets for almost a year, when i was still living with my last girlfriend. i didn't even think about it and slept happily in those sheets that night.

the next day my girlfriend arrives, i pick her up, we have dinner, talk a bit and go to bed at night. action begins, when she suddenly stops and pulls a long, blonde hair from my **** (she has short, dark hair). i only say ""where the **** did that come from?"" and don't waste a second thought about it. action continues.

after leaving that sunday, she begins to behave distantly, doesn't answer messages for hours and says she has a lot of work, so she can't join me next (that is, last) weekend on a little trip to visit some friends (first weekend we didn't spend together). i played along till friday, when her answers began to get truly short. so i didn't message her until she wrote me on sunday evening. 

of course i noticed that something was odd, and when she wrote that she preferred to come here instead of me visiting her, i knew what would happen. so this afternoon she arrives in my town, we sit on a bench and she says that this isn't working, that we have differences, that we should split. she also brings up the hair in my ****, suggesting that i was being unfaithful. i was baffled: that **** hair hadn't been on my mind for two weeks and suddenly it is the main reason why we're splitting up. i tried explaining, but heck, *i'd* probably think the same were it the other way round.

anyway, i told the girl that i was ok with splitting up, because it's true, we're very different on many levels; but that she please should not think it was because i slept with another girl. she only replied: ""well, either way it doesn't matter anymore.""","used bedsheets i hadn't used since my last relationship, girlfriend finds a strange hair in my crotch and dumps me for thinking i cheated on her.**",,,,,,,,,,,,,

,39,part3,relationship,tldr,talking to a girl,0,2,0.5,0,"little bit of background: winter 2013 college semester i started to fall for this girl that i meet through a mutual friend. fast forward to a week after school gets out, she goes home for the summer and i start working third shift, gotta make the money, so she breaks up with me. a week later she starts going out with her friend from back home who she ""wanted to go out before but didn't want to get into a ld relationship, but its cool now because this year he will be going to a local community college that is near the college we go to.""

ok, now back to today, yesterday ex-gf wants to hang out for a bit as we are going to try to just be friends as there wasn't much relationship before we broke up. so i hang out with her and the old feelings resurface in me, time to **** and have some whiskey. 

so today i went to football tailgating at the college i go to, hot greek little sister walks up with her friend ""hey bigwag91, this is my friend hotgurl, blah blah blah, she just got out of a two year relationship. she is just looking to hang out. had i not been thinking about last night (or maybe the hangover of today) i would have seen this as a total green light on hotgurl. later hotgurl is talking to me alot giving little hints that i should have noticed but i couldn't muster myself together enough to take these hints and lay some moves on hotgurl.

later on i ended up having to go up to here and apologize for acting like a complete idiot in front of her and we got to talking. ex lovers, friends, interests, etc, etc. the ex lovers part was the worst cause after talking for 45-60 minutes she looks and me and goes ""you will find someone, don't worry"" but gives major hints that i missed my chance. 

 

p.s. ""today"" is actually yesterday

we got talking. a lot. some days we would both be on overstock or be next to each other on cash registers, so there was always an opportunity to talk.

today, she came in to get some groceries at my cash register. with her husband and child. i swear to the universe that she looks like she could pass off as an 18-20 year old.

i think the rule is to not have any relationships with your colleagues but i work a **** temporary job right now so i could care less. i'm glad i didn't tell her that i have feelings for her.","fell for what i thought was someone my age, in reality was 10 years older than me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

right after graduating high school we were talking about getting together and a summer festival was going down in her town, so i planned to go up there that weekend like a 2 hour drive away.  she had just broken up with her boyfriend like a week before i go up there too!  i get up there an we're doing all this stuff together, like frolfing and hanging out and watching movies till 3am.  we went jet skiing one day and got into a 'water fight'.  the whole weekend i don't make a move because she just got out of a relationship, i was actually dating someone at the time, but that one was doomed, but still loyal didn't want to 'do' anything.

i've been feeling really weird about our relationship recently, as we haven't seen each other much over the past few months and she's been rather cold toward me lately. i woke up this morning feeling very off and just really down. i spent the whole being bummed out and depressed, until the whole thought started to feel kinda silly. she was having a barbecue at her house, and not really wanting to create a scene over there, i asked her to call me after everyone left because i just wanted to talk to her. i've been really missing her and haven't seen her a lot due to school and work and family, so i figured that was probably ask it was. i was wrong. 

i called her when she said most everyone had left and told her i felt silly even asking, but i wanted her to be honest. ""do you still even want to be with me anymore?"" as soon as i said it, i realized i was just being paranoid and awaited her downpour of love and reassurance. i, again, was wrong. instead, she responded with silence, a deep, heavy sigh, and said ""i don't know. i was gonna come over tomorrow to talk with you, and i'd rather do this in person. but you and i are just at different places right now, and i think i just need to be by myself right now."" ****, that came out of nowhere! i've never been hit so hard in my life! that's nowhere near what i was expecting!

fast forward to it being delivered before she came home from work, i decided to get everything set up so she can come right through the door and start eating. so the food is ready and she isnt home, so i decide to tuck in and start eating. she walks through the door and im almost done and she looks at my plate and there hers and asks me why i was eating her food? i explained ""sweetheart this is the dish i usually get and eat?"" she was adamant i was eating her food! so much so she went straight to bed. she hasnt spoken to me since haha, i still cant believe it! must be her pregnant brain :d","my wife think i ate her food when i didnt, im blaming pregant brain! :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have always wanted to do a frame off restoration and have it be something that people looked at and thought, ""what a cool truck"". i wanted to see his memory and our relationship last longer. i have spent the past decade trying to figure it out but i am not a super mechanic, nor do i have a shop to do it in, nor the probably 15k or more that it would take. the truck still runs, it needs a lot of work, the body is in much worse shape than it used to be, apparently these things were prone to rusting out. 

somehow life just seems to swallow up some hopes and dreams and this is just one of them for me. don't get me wrong i have an okay life, just depresses me this has never been something i could have achieved. i have went to banks but they do not want to do loans for restorations and the few companies out there that do, want insane interest rates. i will spare all the boring details, i am going to be getting rid of the truck due to it just getting worse and worse with no luck of doing anything to make it better. i am really bummed to see this happen, but i guess it is time, i am grateful for having the time with ""ol'blue"" (trucks nickname) that i have had. so i guessed i **** up, couldn't plan/appropriate/complete the dream of seeing this memory live on.","grandfathers pickup truck was left to me, wanted to restore it to keep his memory going, dream was buried, now the truck will be going away forever....",,,,,,,,,,,,,

anyway, i have both their numbers in my phone under the name kelly. both are two separate contacts with the same name, as i stupidly put it in that way and never bothered to change it. hours ago, i get the bravery to tell kelly #1 my feelings. i had known her for long enough and i thought that she might feel the same. so i go to text her and realize that there were two contacts. instead of playing it safe and confirming which was which (i had recently deleted the old texts off my phone, so there was no conversation to look through to see which was which), i instead take a guess.

lo and behold, i made the wrong choice and end up confessing my love to the wrong kelly, my friends girlfriend no less. so i rush to explain my mistake to her, however before i can even think of how i was going to explain it, kelly #2 texts back and starts talking about how she feels the same and wants to leave my best friend for me. honestly, i have no idea what to do at this point and i am afraid of losing basically my entire social life over this one **** mistake.","i tried to text my crush my feelings, only to screw up and text my best friends girlfriend. it was made even more awkward when she texted back that she loved me and would leave my friend for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

so i wake up this morning and i'm miserably hungover. it was the kind of hangover where you feel like you have a side stitch, like you just ran a couple miles, but we both know **** well the only thing you're running from is your own past and insecurities. can that cause a side stitch? 

we get to the theater after a quick breakfast and we sit down. this was my first time in imax and it was visually and audibly stunning. then it can became visually and audibly overwhelming. then it became visually and audibly nauseating. then i power spewed pork roll and eggs all over the two rows in front. it really just came out with no warning, like spit up. it's a good movie though.

literally a feeling of shock and horror overcame me. her and i did not have a pleasant ending to our relationship (my fault mostly), and i highly doubt the request was looked upon in a pleasant light. i now feel like a ****.....a total ****. i do not remember the last time i looked him up, but either way i'm sure he saw i sent that request. 


i ended up taking the request back, as well as blocking him. i did this for 2 reasons.....a: hopefully it gives the impression that i did not mean to send that, and i am no threat, and b: i don't ever want to see that page on the interwebs ever again.","i am a jackass, no doubt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

anyway, one day we started talking, one thing led to another, and we were eventually dating. (oh yes, high school dating). so, the relationship seemed to progress as normal (or at least what i assumed to be normal, based on the fact that i never had a prior relationship up to that point in my life). well, one night, we we're over at my house watching a movie and ended up starting to kiss, and then proceeded to cuddle. it was during that point in which i took the time to say ""i love you"", and she seemed fine with it at the time and said it back.

now remember, i'm a socially awkward introvert with no prior dating experience. the only reason i said that was because of the fact that i wanted to show her that i appreciated her taking interest in me and spending time with, being with me, caring about me.

well, in about 1 months time this relationship continued, nothing seemed out of the ordinary, and then the day that finals ended and i was searching for the perfect christmas present on etsy, (which was this really neat handmade bracelet with polymer clay animals), she texted me saying that she needed to stop over and it would only take a minute. then she dumped me, with no explanation other than that she didn't feel comfortable that i told her i loved her, despite that she never communicated this with me. so there i was, christmas approaching, feeling heartbroken, alone, and depressed. i mean, looking back, at least i passed all my exams with flying colors. so i had that going for me, which is nice.","told my girlfriend i loved her, she dumped me",,,,,,,,,,,,,

""free condoms, can't go wrong there!"" i though with enthusiasm. well it went wrong there

the next day, jess and i decide to try the new ones. we start doing our this, wam bam thank ya mam, sexy time complete. the day after she notices when she goes to the bathroom, it hurts. since she still lives with her parents she tells them about the bathroom issue.

so her mom brings her to the doctor, jess tells her doctor (with her mom in the room) that she had **** intercourse the day before. turns out the **** on the condoms caused the infection. the worst part is that her parents now know i deflowered their daughter within a month of dating her.

you see, not only did they have typical room mate habits (not helping, messy, etc...) but they also have these two children. 

these kids are dicks. seriously i do understand it's because of the way they were raised but these kids are little satans. i can't help but hate them. they really are the worst kids i've met.

they came over unannounced to my moms today. it was just supposed to be me coming over with my son...so when they walked in, i had fire in my eyes. i saw visions of all my sons new toys being ripped out of his hands and broken like last year. they really have no control over their kids. 

quickly i grabbed all our things and hid them before they had even a chance. i was not about to have my christmas ruined. luckily my son is not even 2 so he was totally fine with having just one toy. 

so...all the kids play. my sister is their age so they fought over toys for a while. lots of crying and my sister trying to explain nicely why she doesn't want to share.

“i’ll just put it here in this drawer, okay?” i suggest. “you can put it anywhere you want to, son.” i’m not really sure what she means by that. “sure, okay. love you mum.” i attempt to hug my mother but she resists a bit.

“is everything okay? don’t you want to hug your son?” i usually play this game with her, she’s a bit of a sulk so i like to brighten things up with a hug every now and then. she turns to me... “i’m just a bit concerned about you, that’s all”. not the response i expected...

“why? what’s wrong?”...

so i already know i am gonna annoy her with my paper. i researched and did a lot of work on it. i needed a quote though. so i decided to look for the most outlandish person i could think of...****. by gods i found it! i found a quote from **** saying approves german soldiers to take as many women as they like.

so i am trolling hard with this paper, i know i am gonna annoy some people just from how one sided this paper is. well i get into class that day. only to find out instead of her doing all the work...the paper will be peer review. my paper got a lot of hate...but i still got a b+. it wasn't until 3 days later i remembered she was jewish too.",i wrote a paper in my english class about polygamy quoting hitler. the whole class read it and my jewish professor had to give me a b+.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

had a talk with a girl who'd i'd been seeing for the last couple of weeks, we met on tinder but hadn't had **** but have had lots of make outs. hadn't spoken about liking each other yet, just assumed because of the time we spent together. basically went out to dinner with her on the sunday, just talking, laughing, all that good stuff. i invited her round to watch tv or a movie after everything, before we got the bill, she got a text. from then on she wasn't off the phone. not telling me what was going on but she looked upset. 

got to mine and she was stuck on her phone yet again, sat far away from me when usually she'd be sat right next to me, snuggled up. asked her again what was wrong but no answer. then she left to head back to hers.

skip forward to tonight, rang her after a few days to sort my head out as to why things were to weird that night. i told her that i enjoyed being with her but it was unfair to treat me like that, being ignored and given the cold shoulder, even after trying to help. i did say that i really did like her afterwards and she said is that all? the call ended shortly after. 

got a text later 5 min later saying that i'm a nice guy, enjoyed company but doesn't want to take it further because it'd be unfair to me... not ready for a relationship in the end.","assumed a girl wanted a relationship after a few weeks, tried to not be walked over, wrecked a good thing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

about 30 minutes later, i started to hear screaming and crying from my room, so i rushed back. my girlfriend was very angry and accused me of always choosing maths over her and gave me an ultimatum of either i start paying more attention to her or she leaves me. i told her that i can't help being enthusiastic about my subject and she will have to deal with it - she then put her clothes on, walked out and slammed the door. i decided to sleep on it before deciding what to do, but when i tried to contact her via facebook in the morning i discovered her relationship status was ""single"" and that she had de-friended me.","chose to do maths instead of my girlfriend, became single",,,,,,,,,,,,,

one day, i discovered that the gas taps shared the same connector as the water taps, so i plugged in a bunsen burner and started a whole class water fight. poor ms k tried to stop it but couldn't, until she lost her **** and stormed out of the classroom. i went home that afternoon and gleefully described the chaos in the classroom to my mother, who then went quiet and asked in a threatening voice ""you mean linda k? you dared to muck up in front of her?""

i had no idea who this old **** was, and what my mother's relationship was with her. i only found out when she dragged me over to her house to apologise. turns out she was a close family friend and was there at the hospital when i was born. she guilted me by showing me my baby photos. needless to say i pulled my socks up and didn't cause any more trouble in the few remaining weeks of the school year.",had some silly old fart for a substitute. class started mucking up. i made a bunsen burner water gun and started a water fight. didn't know she was a close family friend until my mother dragged me by the ears over to her house to apologise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 i was having spanish class and she being the cool teacher she is, she decides to stop class 20-30 minutes earlier and asks about our lives. she goes around the class and asks us questions. 

my turn, great. ""mr. /u/barra420, do you have a girlfriend?"" i answer, ""i used to"" she then asks what happened. (i met this girl online and started dating her without ever meeting her, yeah i know, what the ****) i proceed to tell her the story of how i met her and she goes batshit crazy. “so you mean you dated this girl that for all you know could be a man? how do you know she wasn’t a **** or something like that? should i talk to the school counselor?” all those types of questions.

i start explaining myself, every single guy in the class by now is laughing their brains off. the girls look at me like i just **** on the bible and waved a confederate flag in front of a black priest. 
after my explanation she decides to change topic and asks what i do on my free time. i answered that i really enjoyed watching movies and spending time on the computer. she then says “i see, so you enjoy watching ****” every single person in the classroom bursts in laughter.

i went to taco bell on my lunch break, ended up going through the drive thru a second time to pick up my co-worker's order. the girl at the window was really cute, and she seemed to be flirting a bit. in hindsight, i'm just really dumb.

anyway, i get back to work, start wondering if i should have suggested grabbing lunch after she gets off work. end up asking a good friend if i should call up there and ask her. he leads with ""that's ballsy as ****."" but makes the excellent point that i'll never know unless i try. 

being thoroughly convinced, i make the call. ask to talk to her. she gets on the phone, i say something like:

so i was on my living room sofa with louise and there was a knock at the door and it was the **** police, so they come in ask all of us questions including my mum because apparently louise's mum reported her to the local police as a missing person and they found my adress from a letter i had written louise in her room. because her mum didnt know she was going to bristol today she got really **** off and demanded louise go back to the north. so long story short she's on her way back home now with the police and i am devastated because my perfect weekend is ruined. i have full trust in louise and i know she didnt intentionally run away from home. i just want this to be sorted out.

so bit of background i’m 25,  i work for a landscape company and have a great
relationship with my boss, we hang out on weekends and he’s the best employer iv ever had, couldn’t ask for better. 

so today we had a very hot day, 35 degrees (95 for the americans). instead of our usual duty’s i was tasked with fitting a flatbed truck with a water tank that we’ve had in storage for a while. 

the day was going sweet, i spent all day drilling and fitting the frame, cleaning, painting and generally doing a great job. 

half hour before we’re due to finish up for the day everyone had assembled back at the workshop, including the boss, the last thing to do was to lift the big plastic tank onto the truck using our crane truck, which is basically a big truck with all the things you could ever need to do our work along with an expensive palfinger crane (for those who are interested)

when we were finally half an hour from home, i burped and he immediately said he smelled methane. so then i launched into a full-on experiment, but wasn't going to tell him about my silent torture. every time i silently burped, he smelled methane. 


we got to the house, aaaand it smelled like natural gas. someone had left the gas-stovetop on for our entire 12-day vacation. we called the fire dept., stood in the rain for thirty minutes while they aired out the house, and woke up all of our neighbors. 


my boyfriend turned to me, quite shaken up, and had a divine revelation. ""i've smelled methane all day! what if it was like, a weird precursor to this? maybe it was some kind of sign from **** or something!""


i did eventually tell him that it was me, burping up my moe's, and that **** had not sent him any sneak-peeks of natural gasses. our relationship is still going strong.",", my moe's-inspired indigestion made my burps smell like methane, i didn't tell my boyfriend why he kept smelling it, our house flooded with natural gas, and my boyfriend thought that the methane had been god trying to warn him.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

how one bad decision leads to another. i've been ill for a while, haven't been sleeping or eating properly either but decide to drink.  want to drink cocktails , thought given recent drinking times i'd be fine and controlled.
nope, i ended up a wasted state.
have been in love with my close friend for years (who i'll just call 'a'),  but i am in a relationship with his best friend (have been for years). this is an open secret however and it is also known that a has feelings for another close friend  of mine ('b'). i also know a used to have feelings for me. of recent, a had been a total **** to me repeatedly so i was already feeling wound up. my frustrations were with him being a shity friend but obviously given the situation it is hard not to and can be justified to jump to the conclusion that his shittiness is due to our past.
so this cocktail of bad decisions is then tested by seeing a give b lots of special treatment and fawning. b has no interest in a and i feel like a is being disrespectful to me by his actions. other close friends bring up with me frequently how a's actions to b are weird and obvious as well as a's actions to me are obvious. should point out that a being so overt is really unusal and he's not had a girlfriend in all the time i've known him or any romantic entanglements besides that i've mentioned.  
so, something in me has snapped and what do i do in my drunken tequila induced state and do not remember? i want to make a hurt how i hurt, so i start slinging really vicious insults about b to a. i said some awful things , words i'd never use otherwise and not even used to describe people i don't actually even like.
a has thrown a drink on me, i attempted to physically retaliate, b has overheard all the horrible **** i have said. 
so i stormed out and got a taxi home and proceeded to cry and get in contact with people at 7am to cry some more because i am sick of feeling anything for a.",don't fall in love with your boyfriend's best friend and don't drink tequila when you're pissed at someone or you might end up being a horrible bitch to your close friends.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

as you can guess, we started making out. but i was just dead tired - and when i get past a certain point of tiredness, my body just takes over and i sleep no matter what. i dozed off... in the middle of a makeout session. and woke up a few minutes later to an understandably **** fiancee.

**context:** my roommate and i, blake, go a long way back, we used to train and race in triathlons across the country together, and even qualified for the 16-19 worlds a few years back. he's since stopped to focus on uni, and i'm still plugging along. needless to say, we're pretty comfortable around each other, and don't really get weirded out by much. i suppose our relationship is similar to that of a non-interracial jd/turk couple.

now we have a 3rd, female roommate, who we both knew would go a little crazy with males once we all moved to the city (we had come from a relatively small area), and we weren't wrong. she eventually calmed down, and has now been seeing someone for over 4 months. let's call him mike.

**the fu:** i was in the loungeroom (downstairs) doing some work on [my bike](http://imgur.com/p44k1jh) when i heard someone walking down the stairs. assuming it was blake, i let my inner /r/bikeporn out and began to air **** to my beloved s-works, while simultaneously putting on my best pornstar performance, as if i were on casting couch.

i open my eyes, and there's mike staring at me from the bottom of the stairs.

""dude, are you okay?"" was his initial reaction, failing to hold back a face of disgust.

the only reply i can muster is ""sorry, i thought you were blake"", which probably only concerned him further. i don't think mike will be too comfortable around me for quite a while.",air jacked to my own bicycle and left my roommate's boyfriend looking a little something like [this](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/what-the-f-tom-delonge.gif).,,,,,,,,,,,,,

salllyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!


was my freshman writing seminar instructor may her name be cursed for a thousand generations. the topic was ""great new books."" being an open-minded starry-eyed freshman, i thought this would mean ""fiction."" nope. poetry. ****. 


so sally always insisted that all of our analytical essays were full of cultural stereotypes. this was really difficult to avoid and got on everyone's nerves, particularly because all the poetry we were reading was really heavy stuff and had to do with race, inequality, poverty, etc. it felt like we couldn't even mention race without being ""insensitive."" fast forward to the final paper.


sally has a friend who is an impoverished poet, and sally assigns us her book (called ""a vertical interrogation of strangers"") to read. the book is basically a collection of poetry based on the author's interviews with anonymous indian women regarding their (often abusive) relationships to men. i choose to write about this book for the final paper. i have had enough of sally and her lectures on ""stereotypes"" at this point. in fact, i am so tired of her that i become convinced that her friend's book is a giant cultural stereotype. i think you can get where this is going...


yup i decide to write my paper on how my professor's starving poet friend's super artsy feminist book is actually a cultural stereotype and unfair to indian men. at the time i thought i made a pretty good argument and was looking forward to changing my professor's perspective on things...

,149,part3,relationship,tldr,"not thinking before i speak, and letting my girlfriend know how i really feel",1,10,0.5,1,"so, as per usual, this didn't happen today, it happened about...7 years ago.

a little context: i'm a musician, mainly a guitarist. i'm a bit of a gearhead, and love shiny new toys.

i was living with my girlfriend at the time, in our first apartment (my first time living away from home, as i'd stayed at home during college). at this point, i had already earned a reputation for saying the wrong thing without thinking. it kind of runs in the family, as my dad and brother are just as bad. nothing intentionally mean, we just say things, and then realize how they sound immediately afterwards. 

i had recently purchased a new-to-me guitar, and was still in the honeymoon phase. i was obsessing over it, and talking about how great it was. my girlfriend made the joke of ""oh, i bet you want to have **** with it.""

without thinking, my mind still on the guitar, i got a kind of disgusted look on my face and responded with:

""no. i respect it too much.""

at which point i noticed my girlfriend immediately moving to the farthest end of the couch, giving me a look that said ""excuse me?""

it's down to how our relationship was (at the time) and how well she knew me that she was mostly **** with me, and enjoying watching me squirm, as she knew that i didn't really mean it like that. 

i wish i could say my backpedalling was skillful and resolved things perfectly.

""no, no, no! i don't mean like that! i mean, it's not *made* for that!""

at which point she got up from the couch and left me to flounder.

we're no longer together, but it's not as a result of this incident (we stayed together another 2 years after that and were happy for a good portion of that).","told my girlfriend i had more respect for my guitar than i did for her, and that she was made for fucking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

a little background to the story. i live with my parents. that is all. 

so i'm laying in bed, had been browsing reddit all morning, and decided to rub one out before i got the day started. like any good son i **** in silence, my whereabouts unknown for approximately 9 minutes (7 minutes spent looking for a good vid). i put one headphone and one out before i got started. i find a good video and get to work. about 30 seconds before my ****, i hear foot steps towards my door. they eventually stop so i get right back into the zone. i hear the foot steps again and am in mid-eruption. i tried to do that thing you do when wanting to last longer during ****, which is to squeeze the tip of my **** in hopes that my **** will delay just a bit more. it didn't work. with all the pressure built up from me strangling my ****, the **** went straight for my face and i didn't have time to dodge the headshot. my mother walks in seconds after this nightmare. i am silent, with one headphone in, and **** all over my face. my roommates have never been one to intrude on my privacy. all my mother said was, ""breakfast is ready,"" and walks out. don't know if she saw what happened. i am scared to leave my room. if my dad finds out about this, he will never let me live it down.","accidentally came on my face, mom walked in offering breakfast.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

then it happened.

i felt a **** coming on. all  tifu  readers know better than to trust a ****, so i slowly and carefully let it out.  halfway through, it felt like there was a **** trying to get out, so i instantly clenched.

do you remember the messages in your facebook feed about how cats take a nap in your engine block to hide from the cold, or even heat? i found out the hard way they're true. 

a little black cat (less than a year old) jumped out from under my car. she had a loosely dangling rear leg and several skin injuries. needless to say, the poor thing was scared out of her wits, not to mention in terrible pain. 

thankfully, an old lady in the street saw me comforting that cat while i was trying to reach several vets (none of whom were in office at that time). she pointed me to where the owners lived. 

so i rang them out of bed, and passed on a couple of the phone numbers i dialed. i'll go check in a few days to see if she's doing fine. 

accidents like this may be unavoidable, but i still felt guilt and responsibility.

**update:** kitty cat didn't make it. :( 

i went by that house again last night to see what was up, but there was no good news to be told. apparently she had gotten a belly wound too. it wasn't immediately visible because it had been immediately scorched shut (and she had black fur too).

my girlfriend and i just moved into a house we bought off foreclosure.  now, most of the house was in good condition, but there was still a lot of work to be done.  we just finished painting everything, replacing the light fixtures, and are in the middle of getting new floors.  one thing we wanted was to have our tv over the fireplace, but when our cable provider sent someone out to hook up our cable he told us he couldn't put a cable outlet there unless we drilled the hole in the attic ourselves.

so fastforward a week and my gf's father decided to go drill a hole in the attic and run a cable through the wall to a new socket he made over the fireplace.  now, he is very good at things like this, but when it comes to electrical work (or anything involving electronics) he is fairly clueless, so when he started talking about how he still needed to run the phone line through the hole for our cable box i started to wonder just what he did.  

so last night i decided to climb up there and see just what he had done.  when i climbed up there and began crossing the attic i learned that the attic wasn't completed, that most of it had only a thin layer of sheetrock between me and the room below, so i stepped carefully to avoid denting the ceiling.  well, on my way back from seeing his work, my foot slipped.  next thing i know i'm hanging from the rafters with my foot wrapped up in a now twisted light fixture.  the light fixture saved me from falling completely, but now it's bent up really badly and there is a four square foot hole in the ceiling with insulation falling out.","got curious what my in-law did in the attic because he doesn't know electrical, went to look, and fell through the ceiling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,159,part3,work,tldr,testing my flame effects in front of my apartment,10,2,1,10,"so i've been working on a flame effect called a fire poofer to install on some skate ramps. the basic concept is that you have a pilot light and a high-pressure regulator that allows you to shoot fireballs [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad0vjj4naba).

the whole thing is controlled by a custom-made pressure plate connected to a battery and an electric solenoid that i have been working on and i was testing the pressure plate but it was not working quite correctly, so i went back into my apartment, leaving the fire poofer outside on the corner.

after a few minutes of drilling holes to attach ramps up onto the pressure plate, i asked my friend who was helping me to go outside to check on the fire poofer. (i live in san francisco and was concerned some homeless person might walk up and try to carry it away).

after a minute or two, when my friend didn't return, i went outside to check on what was up. as soon as i walk out the door, there are 20 cops including their commanding officer (a sergeant i think) all blocking off the street. they had caution tape going in all four directions and i walked up to them and asked what was going on. 

they asked me if the fire poofer was mine and i explained that it was and they asked me what the **** i was doing. i live across the street form a hospital and apparently someone had seen the propane tank sitting on the corner connected to a battery and called the bomb squad! 

they took my id and copied down my information and asked me to explain exactly what the **** i was doing. i walked them through step by step how it all works and showed them the video on my phone linked above. 

half of the cops laughed and said it was cool and were interested, the other half were **** off and wanted to search my apartment. in the end, they all just left and let me take my equipment back inside.

she just stared at me.

i instantly knew she wasn't making a joke and that i was the world's biggest ****. turns out, her brother used to work at a local amusement park which used to have a mini zoo/safari thing. he went in to lion area, and was eaten by a lion. the amusement park doesn't have the zoo/safari any more for obvious reasons. man, i wish i could get that one back.

on the afternoon before a school dinner i'm having a kebab and am reminded of this quote, so i take a picture and caption it with the quote from pakalu. i get some likes, but i leave it alone and don't think too much about it.

fast forward to that evening at the school dinner. i see my crush of nearly 2 years is all dressed up, looking as stunning as one can get in a little black dress. now she walks up to me and asks, ""have you been working out?"" and proceeds to poke my belly, followed by ""apparently not!""

at this point i'm feeling quite astounded and hurt by this unusual greeting (i haven't seen her in a few weeks and i haven't exactly been in tip-top shape of late although i'm not really **** yet) and proceed to tell her so. her close friend, not knowing what's going on either, compliments me on something and i smile and tell her thank you, that's how it should be done, and tell her i like her hair.

my crush on the other hand, realising by now the joke has fallen flat, proceeds to hold out the most beautiful tricep and pinches the non-existent **** and says, ""oh i'm just joking, see how flabby my arm is too!""

at this point all she's managed to do is make me feel even more self-conscious. i walk back to my table and wonder what could have prompted her to say such a thing, and then i'm reminded of dear old pakalu papito. i smile to myself when i realise what's happened, and pull out my phone to check facebook, sure enough she's liked the post. but it's too late to tell her i realised.",when you quote pakalu papito be prepared to receive equally jackass responses from your crush.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

when i was around 13 or so i used to get erections a lot during church. i don't know why. maybe it was because all the women were dressed pretty, maybe because it was inappropriate, therefore i though of it as ""naughty"". all i knew was i got the biggest, blackest **** every sunday. 

 also what's key to this as well is that my grandpa would always have a pocketful of werther's originals to bring to church. we called it church candy. i'd always enjoy a couple of that sweet honey/caramel to pass the time while fighting off boredom sleep/debilitating erections.

today someone offered me a werther's original at work. i commented ""oh man i haven't had these since i would go to church with my grandparents!"" i was super stoked to have one after all these years.

as soon as i popped it in my mouth, i for real got a really good ****. i was laughing so hard when i ate it and couldn't tell my co-workers why.

anyways i've had the ring and was just waiting for inspiration, found it and decided to move forward with my plan to turn this home into an everlasting christmas memory for her. 

i went out and spent some crazy money on christmas lights and other things (we previously lived with roommates and in an apartment and had nothing but a fake tree), i was going to fully deck out our new home in the most epic light show which would dwarf anything the street had...now here's the rub, our house has a metal roof and this winter has been warmer then usual so the snow was melting, in my infinite genius i throw on my dunlops(rubber work boots) and head up onto the roof to hang the lights, now the angle of the metal roof plus the melting snow and rubber boots made traversing a bit of a chore, not impossible  tho.

 i start hanging lights, finish the part that's away from the gutter (no problems) and reach over and start hanging the lights on the  gutter(the roofs to high for a ladder to reach) and suddenly i feel my body start skidding, i have just enough time to twist myself around so i'm going feet first instead of head first and i shoot off the edge of the house and slam into the ground,  ended up with a fractured pelvis spending christmas and new years in the hospital and am now useless for the next 5 months.","hanging christmas light to propose, slid off roof and fractured hip",,,,,,,,,,,,,

a friend and i were working on a project and this involved for me to drill a hole trough several quite large pieces of wood at the same time so there could be a dowel put through the wood.
so after about 5 hours of work i drilled another one of these holes but the different pieces of wood was cut on different angles so it was not possible to put clamps on them so i had to hold them in place by hand.
and you can think of the rest. 
i had to change the drillbit because the first one was not long enough and with the second one i put some pressure behind the drill and then i just 'went trough'. the thing was that my thumb covered the hole where the drillbit came out a little bit. 
a sudden pain. 
thankfully i didn't drop the drill. at first it didn't bleed but then with time it started. i put some paper towels on it and finished the job and went home after that. at home i cleaned and disinfected the wound and inspected it.

i could still see the guy and stared into the disposal in disbelief for a few minutes thinking ""how in the world do i deal with this?!""

now usually i get home before my parents so it was no big deal to just be home all day and nobody would be the wiser. i was incredibly surprised when i heard the front door open about 3 hours earlier than expected when i should have still been at work. i could have just said that i took the day off. i should have just said that i took the day off. however what i decided to do was jump up from my chair and hide in my room.

as i heard my dad come up the stairs i didn't know what i was doing. i hid between my dresser and closet so he couldn't see from my door. i heard him peek into my room and then before i knew it i was hiding in my room wondering what the **** i was going to do. i'd gone to far to just pop out and say whats up now!

after i'd been hiding about 45 minutes i figured i'd wait until it was time for me to come home from work and then i would sneak downstairs and act as if i just got home. easy. ultimately this is what i did but in the hours i waited for this to happen i heard...things... as i'm chilling in my room all of a sudden i hear moans...woman's moans. comprehension struck and i felt the color drain from my face as i realized that my father was watching ****! i inched towards my door and peeked around the corner to where my dad was sitting at his computer and there i saw him actually watching some woman getting dicked down. before i saw anything i would have really regret i slunk back into my room and tried to think of anything else to get what i was hearing off my mind. **** gross.",i stayed home from work and accidentally overheard my father watching porn and probably fapping.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the next morning comes and in the neighbors trash bag is a box for 2 dozen roses and my card that was supposed to come with the flowers. now after work today, needless to say **** is going to go down.

as it turns out, there were too many coats of paint on the wall and the one i added made an older layer peel off.

so now here i am, peeling the paint off of the wall with my hand, hoping it will stop peeling off somewhere so i can get on with the paint job. nope! 2 hours and a lot of frustration later i ended up peeling off all of the paint i had put on, as well as parts of the underlying layer.

in the end i just gave up. instead of 30 minutes of touching up the paint job i'll end up pulling down all the wallpaper and starting from scratch. it'll probably end up costing hundreds of euros too.

i looked around and did not see any other christmas wreaths, but seeing as i just moved in, i figured my lovely apartment building must have given me a holiday gift. note: they also gave me a goody bag upon move-in in october, and the security staff all love me. clearly i'm worthy of a free christmas wreath!

fast forward to a week later--a sunday. i heard a lot of knocking and chatter on doors throughout the evening with much confusion and wondered what was up. then i heard talking outside my door. ""maybe we should just leave a note and ask.""

knock knock knock

i answer. a neighbor and her boyfriend were there. i had met several times prior (they actually gave me a free sam adams mug once, i believe. they won it at an event and the bf didn't want to bring it back to baltimore.

the woman asked if i had seen any christmas wreaths around. i told her what happened. then she replied.

""so ya'll don't have it then?""

""no, i'm saying i do have it. you want it back?""

""oh. yes, please!""

""awww. well, you've ruined christmas for everyone!""

i went and got her the wreath, handed it over, and she and the boyfriend looked pleased, if not bemused. i feel they actually believed me, but today i **** up...by stealing christmas decorations from neighbors.

what i don't understand is how it actually got there. our doors are literally 15 feet apart. we think it fell off and a cleaning lady moved it to my door.",found a wreath at my door one morning. took it happily. week later the neighbors came looking for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,220,part3,work,tldr,trying to relive my childhood,49,4,0.9200000167,49,"so this actually happened this morning before work. i've been staying at my parent's house since my dad has been sick. we've been trying to keep an eye on him. in the guest room there is my old bunk bed and a futon; for a while, id been sleeping on the futon because i'm 26 and felt like i was too old to use a bunk bed. that lasted about two weeks, or until last night, when i decided that i'm old enough to not care if i'm childish sometimes lol. so i slept on the bunk bed, and of course, it had to be the top bunk. my parents live in a small place so the bed nearly reaches the ceiling anyway. slept like a baby. my alarm scared the **** out of me when it went off and i jumped up like usual, hitting my head full force on the **** ceiling. like a five-year-old who just had their toy taken from them, i screamed for my mom immediately. i hear her running up the steps and i'm still a little fuzzy; she tries to open the door but my **** is all over the place and its not budging. starting to realize i'm fine and not five, i shout that i'm fine but its too late. she pushes the door open with all her might and it gets stuck on some clothes; she trips and hits her head on the steel bars of the bed and now i feel like **** because of it. she's holding back tears and rubbing her head while asking if i'm okay, i tell her i'm fine and am apologizing like crazy. then my **** tries to get off the bed and misses the bar causing me to do a split...i'm not flexible at all. so now i'm shouting obscenities and i cant tell if she's laughing or crying. eventually, i got down and everyone was fine. the day was decidedly spent (by my mom) sitting in the living room and talking about how i've always been clumsy and she finds it hilarious. i really can't wait to just go back home to my apartment and pretend this never happened.","i slept on a bunk bed, hit my head on the ceiling, caused my mom an injury, and did a split all within ten minutes of just waking up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

we didn't even make it all the way into the kitchen before clothes started coming off.  she had taken my shirt off and pulled my pants down, i didn't even bother taking my shoes off because this was happening then and there--no time for disrobing completely.  at first she was sitting up on the counter bracing herself with her feet against the fridge while i did my best to **** her right off the counter.  things were going great, except i had yet to notice one of the dogs was standing in the kitchen barking every now and then at us (she was my wife's dog years before we met, and she is very protective).  things escalated and i picked her up and put her on the kitchen table... admit it, so far my lunch is going great, right?

well, that's when **** took a turn downhill.  as many of you know.. a good ol' **** can sometimes sound pretty **** violent--especially when she is screaming.  i didn't think about it because hey, this is normal for us.. the dog thought differently and apparently assumed i was beating mommy.  after a few moments, the dog began barking more, then more, and then... the growl.  i heard it while it happened, but didn't realize it until it was too late.

all of the sudden i could not just hear the growl, but feel it... then, in a moment my **** wont forget for a while, i feel it.  she barks once, and then bites me full on, right on my left **** cheek.  

i instantly go limp ****, and the lunch **** is ruined.  we got a good laugh out of it, but didn't get to finish as i had to go back to work by the time we cooled off from the incident.

,222,part3,work,tldr,refilling my stapler,649,51,0.9200000167,649,"this happened a few hours ago. (on mobile so sorry for **** formatting and errors)

okay so i had an assignment draft due today. nothing big, just two pages but i decided i might as well staple it anyway, just in case it gets lost. 

i go to staple it and what do i find? my stapler is empty. no biggie, i'll just refill it. 

i go to close the stapler and my brilliant self thought it was a great idea to place my thumb where the staples come out. 

a few seconds later i feel a sharp pain on my thumb so i pull my hand away and with it comes the stapler. 

yes, friends. i stapled my thumb to the stapler. 

i lean over to my friend and quietly tell her that i have royally **** myself and, being the good friend she is, she yells across the library to our teacher that i have stapled my thumb. 

my teacher comes over and immediately starts panicking because i have a stapler attached to my thumb. she sends my friend and another teacher with me to the nurse. 

half way there the stapler detaches itself but there is still a staple imbedded in my thumb. 

we get to the nurse and she starts laughing at the sheer  ridiculousness of the situation. she gives me a bandaid and some dettol and tells me to pull it out. 

i grab the staple and pull. immediately blood starts pouring out of the tiny holes because if how deep the staple had gone in. i wipe the blood away and put the bandaid on. 

the nurse gives me a note to show that i've been to her, on which she writes ""stapled finger"".  

i get back to my class and i glue the staple to the note because why not. then i decide to actually staple my assignment. i look through it to make sure everything is there and what do i find? the second page is blank. i didn't need to staple my assignment at all. 

this whole situation could have been avoided if i had just checked my work first.

i work at a huge waste disposal site, and i have the responsibility for all the hazardous waste that comes in. so today was just a regular day, sorting out all the hazardous waste like paint, oil, batteries etc. when i was done sorting everything out i took myself a well deserved break. 
so i was sitting in my chair casually reading the daily newspaper when suddenly the valve for the emergency fire hose exploded. apparently the water pressure had been on the entire time which ended flooding the entire station. there wasn't much i could do since the only person who knew where the main switch for the water supply was my boss. 

this is where everything went to ****. beneat the emergency fire hose was a huge fuse-box to power the entire station, well all i can is that it broke pretty **** fast. now my boss blamed me for not turning the pressure off which ended in me getting fired. so now i'm at home playing league of legends and listening to bruce springsteen.",valve for the emergency fire hose exploded and ended up flooding the entire station. got fired because of it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i put milk on the stove and then went 
to the bathroom to shave, which in itself is not a good idea.

while sitting on the toilet i was listening to my ipod classic and began
to put on a landing ****. approching take off i cut myself and propelled my ipod into the bowl, panicking i get up knocking my head against the mirror door.

so by this time i'm lying on the floor bleeding at multiple spots and confused as ****. after realizing what has happend i plan on getting my ipod and turning it off. easier said than done, grabbing it out of the bowl i notice that i got no idea how to accomplish this trivial seeming task.

sprinting to my laptop and getting blood everywhere i hold play on my ipod. nothing happens. i figure out that i have to hold play and center, wait for it to boot up fully(which is an eternity for apple products) and then turn it off. after 2 minutes or so i finally succeed. 

remember the milk from the beginning? well me neither. but my alarm did and comes screaming at me while i'm disinfecting nearly giving me a heart attack.

you'll probably like to know if the ipod is working.
it does, but it displays a firewire not plugged in message from time to time (which makes sense i guess, since firewire isn't plugged in)

so i'm currently working abroad, in france, and i'm currently moving all my stuff to paris (i live in a neighbouring city 1h40-1h50 by train). since i'm moving into my new apartment tomorrow, i thought it'd be best to take as much clothes with me on the train and drop them off before going to work. so, i'm walking down an empty street at 6:00am with two huge bags because i'm trying to catch the 6:30 train and when i'm a block away from the metro station i realize my passport wallet was missing. turns out my passport wallet that contained both my passports (i'm a dual citizen) and my discount card, fell out my back pocket due to my bags hitting it.

anyways, because i'm also in a ldr, i really haven't felt the need to impress anyone at all so i've neglected to shave for probably ~6 weeks or so...which has resulted in a nicely fruitful amazon forest. i also just hate shaving and haven't had time.

because of this, i know for a fact the bath water is gonna be full of hair so i grab my cup and use it to rinse the shaver off with. alright, awesome. so i've shaved my legs, armpits, and tacobits and by now you can't even see the water in the cup, it's just a black mass of lady greenery. 

i continue on with the rest of my bath as normal, and then wash my face last. my eyes are closed because of said **** wash and as usual, i reach for my rinsing up. i think you already know where this is going. i thought to myself, oh the cup is already full of water awesome and proceed to dump it on my head.",pampered myself by dumping ~6 weeks of armpit/leg hair and pubes on my head.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so i was reading that north korean defector with gbs of data on human rights violations post, when i see a thread talking about how he escaped. i haven't read enough to know how so i see people suspecting he went through russia to eventually end up in finland. someone else confirmed that he actually went through the philippines to get to his final destination. 

that's when someone says ""ah malaysian airlines, perfect choice for a guy looking to disappear.""

i work in it, i should know better than to have a drink at my desk but well... it's a very casual work environment, and i was thirsty. not casual enough i can spray my desk with a few ounces of diet pepsi though, which happened just as loudly and violently as possible. 

my coworkers panic and think i'm gagging, so they all come over. i'm frantically trying to clean up before it touches any paperwork or **** up my work computer. none of that's touched, but the 60$ apple keyboard i use is drenched. 

coworker asks whats wrong and without thinking i reply ""oh this **** joke on..."" and it hits me. ""uhh... yeah just a joke i read. whatever, i'll go grab another keyboard.""

coworker: ""wow dude. ****? that must be some joke. what is it?""

me: ""uhh...""

boss *approaching*: ""hey, what's the commotion?""

so... i just had to explain to my boss that i ruined a keyboard (not a big deal) over a terrible *yet oh so hilarious* joke (more of a ""why does he find that funny?"" deal) because he saw it on my screen (also not a big deal) because i couldn't tab out because i *ruined* my keyboard.

anyways, my machine uses glue and i had a spot on my glue pattern that wasn't transferring right. usually it's a piece of glue stuck somewhere, and this was no different. so i went to fix it, usually doesn't require getting into the machine and can be fixed while running without putting yourself in danger. as i was getting up, my head is violently yanked backwards and i hear my paper web snap as my head hits the machine. searing pain followed by my machine stopping occurred. i got up cursing like a **** sailor, and look at what devastation my hair has wrought on my machine. paper web is broken, paper is everywhere, i'm gonna have to re web it(which is a royal pita...) and then i notice the blood. not a lot, but enough to make me feel the back of my head, which is bleeding pretty good. didn't pull much hair out, just cracked my skull pretty good. ended up needing three stitches as well. thankfully the machine was fine though, other than needing to be webbed up again.","i'm a hippie man-child with long hair, and my machine decided it didn't like my hair and i should bleed for my sins.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

so were all happy to be back together all weekend and sunday turns immediately into an aggressive sunday-funday. grad school friend brings myself and another one of my friends around campus while the other part of the crew is re-upping at the liquor store.

its a beautiful campus, there's an amphitheater in a nice open area and, due to alcohol, we start using the amphitheater as a playground and start jumping around and just overall having a good time.

liquid confidence is very high at this point so i jump a gap in the amphitheater. nailed it. liquid confidence lvl: **** see a trashcan near me among the same height as i am. so i go for it.

as i am flipping backwards and sideways, i realize that the trash can isn't bolted to the concrete square in the grassy area its standing on. i also realize its completely empty. i figure, if this goes bad i fall in the grass, say ow, and continue on with the day.

instead, i go straight right instead of any other direction, and meet the concrete sidewalk with the right side of my face, left wrist, and somehow sprained my left ankle.

i'm feeling like **** by this point so i take a break and sit down at the back of the shop. right now i'm starting to lose feeling in my hands, legs and face and it's being replaced by this insane vibration. i feel like i'm going to **** pass out. my whole body is oscillating and i think i'm going to die.

eventually my body stops vibrating, and after some water i settle down and take the night off. i still feel like i want to **** but at least i'm not passed out. 

it turns out that i should have not only read the coffee packet for the *expiry date* but i should have also checked to see that it was really *instant coffee* (which you only really need use one teaspoon of, i probably had the equivalent of about 7 or 8 cups of coffee in one hit. my normal amount is about twice a month!)

 

edit: it was about the equivalent of around 10-12 cups apparently. the instant coffee was powder that you just put into hot water, it had about 50mg caffeine in less than a teaspoon of powder and the group holds around 10 teaspoons. so i'm guessing that was almost 0.5g or more of caffeine

then near the end of the day, a man and his son came in saying that they were here to buy the bike they were going to buy yesterday but had to wait for the manager to assemble it. i asked what it was and the father said it was a medium black and green quick 4. i discreetly told the manager who'd stayed after closing yesterday to assemble the bike for him. so then he had to tell the man that we'd sold the bike earlier today because no one had told me about it. the man was very upset and left saying he'd never spend money here again. luckily the manager wasn't upset with me, he was more upset with how the man was so upset. so i still haven't **** up this job but i'll let you guys know if i do.",sold a bike that someone else was waiting to buy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i work at a local hardware store, and i get to my usual moring task of cleaning out our paint tinting machine. 
the machine says two colorants are low: a purple one and a blue one.
i go and refill them. i refill the blue one first. then the purple.
as i was finishing, by chance i looked at the can of colorant that i had just filled the purple tank with.
and at that moment i knew.

i **** up.

i had just poured the blue colorant into the purple tank, and vice versa. 
i had gone through a training course for tinting paint, and the number one thing they drilled into my head was:
don't mix up colorants, because if you mix them up, it can no longer tint accurately and the whole machine has to be sent out for cleaning and repair.

i go to the back and immediately unplug the machine and urgently call my manager over on the radio.

...when she got there and i explained what happened, i've never seen her cringe like that before in my life. 
...it may be safe to say she might not be my manager for much longer.

 

edit: update. luckily, i have another co-worker that knows how to flush and clean out the machine in the store. apparently this isn't the first time this happened, so he went ahead and cleaned out the machine for me, and my manager has no hard feelings, because accidents happen.

yesterday i reinstalled windows 10 from the image i made myself a few days prior, thinking that it would be the pro edition i thought nothing of it, did a few things around the house while it was installing and updating got back and realised it was the home edition, at first i thought nothing of it tried to do some modded minecraft and it ran at what felt like negative frames per second. thought something was up and found out that home couldn't give enough ram for what i was needing so i ended up reinstalling windows 7 ultimate to get it to windows 10 pro (via free upgrade thing) but that produced problems because i didnt have a product key that would work (i used to run windows loader to get the keys to work and used it to install windows 7 on friends and families machines) thankfully i found a windows 10 disc that has pro on and ended up using that.

""talk about a situation where teamwork and collaboration really made a difference.""

i blurted out the most recent situation that came to mind without stopping to consider things more broadly.

""i'm captain of my soccer team.  and practice this past friday was attended by quite a few girls.   everyone's first instincts are to show off and be as impressive as possible.  but i decided to hold back and give my team mates a chance to shine.""

my interviewer's demeanor visibly changed, and i realized immediately that she wasn't at all keen on my answer.   i shifted gears and provided another example about a group project at school.

it failed to rekindle her interest though.  she said nothing about either of my examples.   she asked no follow up questions at all.  

""do you have any questions for me?"" she asked tersely.  when all was said and done, the interview ended 10 minutes early.

about 15 years ago i worked in a microbiology lab in the media kitchen area.  basically my job consisted of washing dishes but i also sometimes was put to work making reagents, filling petri dishes, etc.  

on this particular day i was set to task to make a blue dyeing reagent meant to be used in a production run for a stool sample testing kit.  since it was for production and not just lab use it was very important that it be made correctly. this was stressed to me repeatedly. ""this needs to be by the book!""

so instead of just processing off the order sheet i pulled our department reagent book to get the official formulation and created the item from that.  now is where the fu comes into play.  whoever it is that put in the order had at some point changed the formulation and we had an old copy of it in our book.  the book showed the weights listed in mg or milligrams, but the order had it in mcg or micrograms.  so i proceed and process the order by the book!

reagent goes off to production and is ran and made into testing kits.  the next day quality assurances pulls a few kits to test and they fail.  horribly.  why? well there was 1000x more blue dye than the order called for.  

i get pulled into a meeting where i get dressed down about this fu that's costing the company thousands to fix.  i am beside myself with guilt and apologize.  when i notice the discrepancy i bring it up to the person who ordered the reagent, she takes it to my boss's direct supervisor who then dresses down my boss for the fu of not updating the formulation book for 3 years.  i then get treated like a **** for the remaining 6 months i worked there.","too much blue, my boss blew, his boss blew, now i'm blue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

so here is the back story. few years ago i moved into my brothers home the same place i grew up for most of my life. paying my bills and being a young dumb kid. i moved into this place when i was 18 ish. i'm 21 now.

as for the ****. over the past few years i have asked my brother about fixing several of the minor issues this house has. he lives in another state and generally didn't want to fix anything cause it was ^fine^. so i took it upon myself to fix up what i could. including replacing the broken outlets, patching water damaged drywall, replacing broken pipe fittings. some of the outlets would just ^pop^ surge protectors. pipes leaked even in the winter. the furnace could barley keep the house at 60. ac didn't work at all when i moved in but it works now. things along those lines. i've kept the carpet clean and did what i could having a extremely limited budget. i've had some friends live with me to help me do thing and pay for things as well. 
well i was getting ready to move out. started fixing the walls up the best i could and handing the sewer main that backs up every time someone poops. my brother sent over some friends and they inspected the house saying i completely ruined it. they have never seen the house before they looked at it today. now my brother is saying every thing remotely wrong with the house is my fault. the foundation falling in. the missing siding. the window that fell out. the water damaged drywall. everything. so he is throwing me out with 1 months notice. yet he is still expecting me to pay the rent for the month. so at the end of the month i will have less than 70$ to my name and have to find a place to live. i don't have family i can stay with and my friends are not able to accommodate me. selling all my junk to hopefully grab a hotel for a week or two and get my life together.","i shouldn't have tried to fix anything, i did fix thing now everything's my fault and i'm homeless.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

i crawl into bed, and, knowing myself, i wake up every few hours to readjust. i would set my watch to beep, but i felt that, for sure, i would have woken up. on days like this, my parents call me to make sure i don't sleep through it, anyway. i close my eyes and fall sleep very quickly.

i wake up, and after moving around a bit and unswaddling myself from the blankets, i suddenly notice that it is dark. ""oh ****, what time is it?"" i fumble with the button on my watch that activates the backlight. i finally press it. 

""6:45""

i rushed home after work to get ready to meet my so for dinner. i just needed to shower and change clothes but my contacts have been bothering me for 3 or 4 days (left eye has been blurry) so i decided to put new ones in too. 

in a rush i threw my old ones in the trash and got two new ones out. my eyes have different prescriptions, the left has an astigmatism which requires a special lense, so i double checked that i was putting them in the correct eye. 

the right one was perfect and felt great (anyone with disposal contacts knows how great new ones feel). my left eye was still really blurry and bothering me like the old contact. oh well, sometimes the astigmatism lenses take a while to align correctly with your eye and it can be blurry. 

five minutes later it was still bad so i took the new lense out, rinsed it and tried again. still blurry. ****, this is annoying. guess i'll shower quick and see if it aligns. nope. 

**** **** ****. what's wrong with my contact? what's wrong with my eye?! eye problems run in my family (mom almost had a retina detach once), did something just happen to my **** eyeball??! it's been bad the last few days and i haven't had a check up for 1.5 years! 

i get out and take the lense out to inspect it. looks fine. but wait... i can see better with it out. i look closely at my left eye in the mirror. ****! i never actually took the old lense out and i had been wearing two stacked on top of each other. it was pretty relieving but i feel like an idiot.

i didn't realise how steep the edge was until i was standing over it, but i slid down (in my professional work attire) and walked across to the other side. that's when i really realised how steep it was, and how much of a **** gravity is.

unable to get up the other side, i ponder my situation and start walking the length of the drain hoping the edges will either become less steep, or lower. 

i came across a couple of wet, slimey pipes, but they were too slippery for my to hoist myself up.

i had visions of me having to call my mother (who lives an hour away) or the fire brigade to help me because i'm a lazy ****, but after about twenty minutes of solid anxiety and embarrassment i found a dry pipe and used it to climb out.

i fell for him instantly. thankfully, he found me 7/10 would talk to again and we became friends. pretty soon, we started dating. something about him always really intrigued me... his smile reminded me of my dad (who passed away when i was 5). it made me a little uneasy (especially since my ex is adopted from my dad's home city with no inkling of his past), but my grandma (mom's mom) was like ""no trust me. everyone in [dad's home city] has that snarky snarky smile.""

anyways, 3 years later, my beau proposed to me. we made plans for me to move in with him since i was living with my grandma (mom's mom) at that time. on the last day, i went to the basement to get my stuff and found a photo album that belonged to my late mother. in it was ... a picture of my dad!

my heart pretty much dropped. my dad was 46 when i was born, so i never imagined that he would look anything other than being half bald and ****. i also didn't see many pictures of him because my grandma disliked him and never kept any in our house.

early this morning, i awoke to my friend yelling ""goddamnit, diva!"", presumably getting up to cover her cage, then slamming her door. this was totally out of character and, in my opinion, immature.

in my angered, delirious state, i drafted a text to her that i planned to read and decide whether to send when i woke up:

""i heard you flip out on diva this morning, so i think we should start covering her at night so we don't get woken up. but you have got to be better about uncovering her when you leave for work. close to 50% of the time, i come home to see she's been covered all day. we can put a post-it on the front door or leave something on the key rack to remind you when you're about to leave if you really have a hard time making it a habit, but she can't live in darkness for hours on end. deal?""

 that he was standing up for someone). the entire class proceeds to laugh at me for being such a **** and looking up to this guy. did i mention we have a kid doing a paper on putin on heroism??? so i turn red faced and mentally face palm as my teacher ( who is a great guy) turns off the smart board and prints me a massive article on bono. i am so embarrassed i am afraid to ever mention my music tastes again. and the icing on the cake? the band i hate the most ( behind one direction and those types of ""bands"") is u2. ****.",i searched my idols criminal record and showed his bad side to my entire class.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i immediately knew i **** up, that's why i came here. 

plus she's the **first** girl i ever picked up with a car.

we had a good time. with the chinese new year festive season the movies were so packed but thankfully we got good seats. 

but that's not the point here. 

i don't have a physical memento of today. no photo. 

i don't even have the movie tickets with me. she has them .... 

first, we bought the tickets. then since we still had time before the movie starts i decided to sit down and have a chat with her. we only had like 40 minutes before the movie starts. 

after chatting so long i realized this is my chance to get a photo taken, i took out my phone, asking what phone she's currently using cause she lost her phone to robbers months ago. i thought this was my chance, but then she kept on going about how she got robbed and i can't allow myself to stop the topic as i find it is actually a sensitive matter, plus i wanted to know more too. so i lost my chance. then we had to quickly go back to the cinema and buy popcorn & drinks last minute, and proceeded into the halls.

after the movie, i was thinking: *you know what? i'll just stop in front of her house later, then take a photo together before i drop her off. okay sounds like a perfect plan.* we had to rush because she's going off to her grandma's place for dinner later and we're a little late. 

here comes the **** part. 

we arrived in front of her doorstep.......................  holy **** her family are all outside waiting for her ! **** this. 

i can't take a photo with all her family outside the house waiting, i'll look like a dumb ****. seriously. 

i left the scene, **crushed inside.**

for midnight shift workers, they are a total pain. add in a movie as popular as deadpool, and they've become a right nightmare.


it's a saturday, i'm working midnight shift and i get tired of hearing doors opening and kids giggling etc. i decide to do what our rent-a-cop won't do: tell a kid off. partly to ease my boredom, partly to hopefully teach these kids a lesson. 


i walk down the hall where a gangly young teen is loitering by the bathrooms. i ask him what he's doing and he points to the women's bathroom and says, ""waiting on her.""  i assume he's talking about another teenager, so i tell him to get back to his movie. he seems hesitant, but i insist, saying that i'll wait for his friend. (i'm assuming she's also a teenager bent on causing trouble.)


he makes a beeline for deadpool, and when i ask to check his ticket to see if that's his correct movie, he says he doesn't have it. it's at this point that his mother comes out of the bathroom, to find her teenaged son crying, standing in the hall with a stern (and then confused) looking theatre worker. she turns to him, saying, ""what's wrong?"" she then asks me what he did. 


i have to explain to this woman that i assumed her teenaged (obviously emotionally or mentally delayed) son was sneaking into an r rated movie without a ticket. she understands, but by this point this poor kid is properly crying and is scared that he's in trouble and that i'm going to kick his family out of the film. 


i apologized for the misunderstanding, hating myself a little and thinking that maybe the do-nothing rent-a-cop has the right idea after all.","fussed at an innocent movie goer while trying to assert my dominance and instead just asserted that i'm a jerk, managing to make a possibly mentally delayed teen cry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

as were stopped at this one particular servo, about halfway into the trip, i see what excites most 6 year olds, a giant freezer dedicated to icecreams. yet my dreams of having an icecream to myself were crushed as my parents denied me as, understandably, its a very messy thing to have on a car trip for a kid my age.

well heres where the real fu begins. i see my older brother, by about 3 years, sitting outside, eating a **** icecream! i was as enraged as a 6yo can get. so i did what came natural, and i stormed up from behind, tapped him on the shoulder, and with as much sass as i had, proceeded to yell at him ""why do you get a icecream and i dont?!"".
needless to say, the boy who turned around who was infact was not my brother, but wore a very similar shirt, had a look of confusion and fright, and proceeded to hurridly move to the comfort of his parents, now standing just a few meters away.

well with so much going on, i have plenty to do and missed the ""your financial aid is ready"" email that goes into my official school email. now this set of financial aid is for the upcoming winter quarter (which doesn't start until late september) and i thought i had plenty of time to accept the money that the school/government/loan sharks are giving me, so i put it on the back burner, choosing to give my research papers and coursework priority. 

today i finally have a breather and check up on misc stuff while at lunch. i thought: hey, let's go do my financial aid!. i log into my university account and see that i have no financial aid available (which is strange, because my family is not all that wealthy [just above the lower mid-class definition line] and i usually get 12k-15k in aid, towards the 30k tuition) then i notice the big message: last day to accept financial aid is august 7, failure to do so will mean a withdrawal from aid. wait, what day is it? ****

when i woke up, i couldn't open my right eye because it was swollen shut and my thumb was so swollen it was stuck in a ""thumbs-up"" position. my bottom lip made me it look like i was doing a bad sylvester stallone impression and i was riddled with these red circular raised spots on my chest. skipped class for the day and missed the exams. the swelling magically subsided by the end of the day though. i found out later that i had been feasted upon by cockroaches. apparently they like to nibble on fingernails and eyelashes, especially when coated with chicken oil.

under the chairs, they placed cards(you know like the one's to win a prize), so me unknowingly sat on one of those chairs. 

the card had a symbol that was unknown until later on. my mind was telling me to give it to a girl from my class but my mind said no.

later on, they said those with that card had to dance. my mind was **** up. my heart started beating. so i walked up and had to chose a dance to dance to. i drawed it and it was...... watch me whip(or whatever the **** that dance is called).

so when it was my turn, i was one if the few people who didn't know how to dance to it. i was forced to do it as i couldn't drop out. while this was going in, the back of my neck was paining like *insert **** word here"" ****.

afterwards, the embarrassment **** me over. i felt like ****. my mind was uneasy. after all this bs, they then said it was able to view on the school's website.

we spend the entire wedding flirting and the day after she comes over to the house where i'm staying at with my family. we cuddle, and we're alone in the sitting room on the sofa with me stroking her hair. i convince her to head outside and while we're walking i try and kiss her. she's too shy (mentions moving too fast) and pulls back, but the mood is good, so i'm okay with it -- instead, we walk back holding hands.

then one of my uncles shows up looking furious. he proceeds to ask me what the **** i'm doing with my cousin.

i'm horrified. i get this awful cold feeling inside and look at her. she's obviously dumbstruck as well. my family doesn't have much contact with our overseas family, which is pretty large, so there are a lot of members of my family i've never met (which was part of my why i was at the wedding). i naturally let go of her hand and head straight to my mother (who's sitting with her sisters) to find out the truth.

she explains that yeah, the girl's my cousin, but we're not related by blood -- one of my relatives got married to hers the year before, but it's still frowned upon.

i couldn't get to sleep easily, so i decided to lay awake until my sister woke up to go to work (she has to leave for work at 3am) and take her comfy double bed with a plethora of pillows.

once she finished getting ready for work and left, i immediately got up and into her room. i noticed she left her sheets and pillows in a mess, so i start rearranging them. the first thing i do is move her main pillow from where it lay, and my hands catch an object underneath.

i placed the pillow aside and look in horror as i've just picked up my sister's vibrator. large, pink vibrator.

my day started well, favorite breakfast, lunch at the street corner on my work, and dinner with friends and family. now as i lay in my bed, my phone beeps for an alarm for my birthday with a letter attachment to it. i wrote myself a letter last year of the things i should do, adventures i should take, lessons i need to learn etc. as i go through the letter i can’t help but notice that i almost accomplished all of those things on the letter.  except for my biggest fu.

i told myself to stop dating different girl every month and just focus on one. and i did. i met her, and with her i am me, no holding back, no lies, not pretending, i am just me. last year was an amazing year because i have her. then i fu. i broke up with her because i got cold feet and i thought we were going too fast and we are going serious too soon. 

now that it is my birthday, i never felt alone. yes, i have my family but i have an estranged relationship with all of them. i have my friends who i met through games but i they never understand the real me. i had her, nothing else matter except her but i lost her because my 25 year old me broke up with her one sunny wednesday thinking it is the right thing to do. of course the player in me, ignore all her calls, and texts, and never answer the door to even just talk. 

if i could go back to fall of last year, i would kick myself in the balls, or i would even touch habanero peppers then remove my contacts and **** without even washing my hands to learn my lesson.

so i assumed i must have picked up some kind of keylogger on some dodgy site. i changed all my passwords to everything using my cell phone, which was a right pain in the ****, ran a virus scan, the works.

'what the **** is going on!' i thought to myself, feeling pretty bloody freaked out. the really freaky thing was that the comments didn't have that little star by them that tells you they've been edited, and every time i changed them they changed back, like someone was waiting for me to notice and messing with me.

i decided to try another browser to see if that shed any light, and the comments were unchanged! then i remembered that, ages ago, i installed the downworthy addon to chrome, which basically changes the clickbait titles of those **** buzzfeed articles you see on facebook. it had been picking out certain words in my comments and replacing them (not in the actual comment just so that i would see them differently) and so i've wasted a bunch of time and now have a bunch of new passwords to remember. i am an idiot.","wasn't hacked, installed a stupid chrome extension and freaked myself out for no good reason.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

with all this in mind, when i came up for air to find a few more people standing near me (importantly, i was between them and the shore), i gave up, fancying a rest and a bit of a chat.

""lovely day for it, isn't it!""
""yeah, guess it is...""
""you local?""
""yup...""
""wow, must be amazing to live near a place like this!""
""...""

i was baffled! i'd always thought americans were supposed to be friendly, but two of the three decent looking gentlemen were staring straight past me, while the third glowered at me with an intensity normally reserved for tarantino films. all in all, it put me off my swim completely, so i turned for shore...

...and bumped straight into the pastor, lifting the young lad who was being baptised out of the water. down the three of us went together, in an almighty (pardon the pun) splash of limbs. i cannot underestimate the size of the crowd i had somehow failed to notice watching. although the pastor found it funny, the kid seemed utterly horrified (if you fall over during your baptism, do you go to ****?) and his parents weren't much happier.

i wake up and immediately notice that it's dark out and think that i slept all the way until the next morning. i still had homework to do so after checking my phone it was 5:46 i thought ""if i hurry i should be able to do my homework before school."" and start going into overdrive trying to get ready. i check in my closet and don't see any uniforms. i sprint downstairs still completely **** from sleep. as i'm sprinting downstairs i start to hear people talking and that's when any completely awake person would stop and think for a bit, not me apparently. before i could really even register it i was in my kitchen surrounded by my **extended family** completely ****.",ran into a family dinner and forgot i wasn't in a nudist colony.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

as a young kid i didnt know  the virtues of patience. as im sitting waiting for my rod to **** while eating my cheeto puffs. i see a **** ton of geese (which i confused for sweet 'ol ducks). 

the innocent me thought ""i will feed these nice ducks"". as i get up to go walk over there, my mother instantly knew what i was up to and said  something along the lines of ""dont feed them they'll chase you"". what does she know? i've fed ducks plenty of times. i pretended i didnt hear her and continued on. 


i toss a cheeto into the water and here come the ""ducks"", one eats it right up. i toss a couple more into the water. i didnt want to give all my cheetos so i decided enough was enough. 

this is where the **** begins. the moment i stopped feeding these ""ducks"" they all start to come out of the water. i remember this ""oh shit"" feeling. before i knew it i was out numbered. i wasnt letting them take my cheetos. so i decided to run. these ducks start chasing me. the **** where determined. my whole family is sitting there laughing while im in some serious **** with a gang of geese. 

i see my grandpa in the distance, i remember running torwards him hoping he would save me (my grandpa was my protector). he had hes back torwards me and went into the porta ****. didnt even see me in distress. 
i see an empty one right near him so i decided to hide in that. 

i run in slam the door shut. i turn around and remember seeing **** wasp flying out of the ****. i freak out and run back outside. forgetting about this gang of geese wanting me dead for my cheetos. thank **** my mom ended up coming and scaring them all away.

we arrived at the airport with 2 hours to spare thankfully, but when it came to tsa checking our ids i didn't have mine. after a discussion with one of the officers they told me they would let me through but i had to answer a bunch of personal questions to make sure i was who i said i was, despite my picture being on my dad's credit card and the fact that i look almost identical to him. 

it took about an hour to get through security and i was able to make the flight. however, i was warned by tsa they can only do this kind of once. this is a problem since i also had to fly back from florida after the vacation.

(weird saying, huh?) anyway, met the family and some new friends and had a good time. 

now, it turns out there was a plan to get me initiated as it was my first polish easter. basically at midnight on the sunday night/monday morning, they throw water over everybody. so at midnight, everybody got a mug of water and waited to throw it at me as i was the newbie. we were already standing outside chatting and i had no clue what was going on, i thought they were just getting a drink. at midnight, they all threw it at once. i was soaked. pretty funny though!

anyway, that's not the ****. as i didn't know and i hadn't wet anybody myself, one of the guys who i've met a few times before said i could throw water at him as he was last for this to happen to on a previous year and he wanted me to be involved. so i was given a mug of water and i threw it at him. however, my hand was wet from being soaked and i wasn't holding the mug by the handle. so i ended up throwing the whole **** mug by accident. the shot was perfect. for his face. ****. bruise on his nose. 

he was a bit startled but took it well though. he said it and he was okay, and i apologised profusely but everyone said don't worry, it's a new story to tell people. he might have a headache this morning though...

midterms were amongst us, and on this particular day i had my physical education course's exam. the exam was made up of three parts, all under a [pacing program]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5vvroplaw4&feature=youtube_gdata_player): running (linked), push ups, and curl ups. this story revolves around the curl ups.

my friend and i had just returned from doing the push up test, and has decided to get the other ""easy"" test out of the way.  we were part of the last group of people to go up at that time.

after minutes of anticipation, we get set up to start the test.

""we begin in three... two... [beep]""

i lift myself up from the mat, to feel a very distinctive rumble in my nether regions.

*oh, **** no.*

at a very young age, i thought i had the ability to perform ""automatic farts"" (that's a story for another time; i was one of the weird but kind of cool kids), and would always be quite the entertainment source for friends and family members. until a later age, i never realized i was, in fact, performing queefs. from the years of doing this, i gained quite the exquisite muscle ability in these regions. with such power, it sometimes became abit... uncontrollable.

the muscle contractions from performing these curl ups were causing me to ****.

i was, luckily, saved by the blaring speakers placed right next to my testing mat. but i fear a couple were quite audible- considering the look on one of the coaches faces whilst i was leaving the test area.

i excuse myself from the table and sit on the can. not a second later the brown waterfall begins splashing into the water, accompanied by sounds which i never thought my stimach would be capable of making. this continued for roughly 25 minutes, with short pauses in between the torrential shitstorms. i could hear the sounds of fidgeting and discomfort coming from the other room, and by the end i felt embarrassed but extremely relieved.

so, i pick up the canister, find a lighter that was in a toolbox, and turn the can upside-down. i then proceeded to light the lighter to the air displacement hole(having closed the pouring hole), holding the can an inch from my face as i do so.

of course, the can then exploded with enough force to shake the neighbor's houses on both sides of the house.

it simply singed my fingers. not burnt, singed. how is my face still intact? no idea. how did i not catch steel shrapnel to various parts of my body? you've got me.

to everyone else: i'll explain

tonight was the second night of hanukkah (spelling? nobody knows). basically hanukkah is a jewish holiday that's celebrated over 8 nights. you also traditionally eat jam doughnuts. that's irrelevant, but nice to know.
anyway, the important bit is that every night, after sunset, you light one more candle on the hannukiah. a hannukiah is a candle-holder/candelabra that holds 8 candles and 1 elevated candle which does all the work called the shamash. these candles dont' last that long - about an hour - but you light another series each night.
most jewish families have a nice and elaborate hannukiah. this thing is a family heirloom and is used only during the holidays. some families have one per family member, some have one for the family.

my daughter is now 3 years old and so i hit upon the incredibly awesome idea of creating a hannukiah just for her out of duplo and sugru. i'm an awesome dad who spent a good afternoon with his girl doing something creative and not watching peppa pig for the millionth time. i'm ready for my award.

that was last week. 

last night was the first night of hanukkah and it worked like a charm!
we had guests so we only let it burn for a few minutes (yes, we're not orthodox and probably broke some rules - that's not the point)

tonight we lit it again (2 candles) and i put it safely on the top shelf in the living room while i went into the kitchen to talk to my wife...

cue: fire alarm! house full of black smoke! black ceiling and a melting hannukiah dripping with big flames licking up the shelf!

,410,part3,family,tldr,being an inebriated asshole,13,7,0.8100000024,13,"here's the story, over the weekend i went out with some friends with the plan of crashing on their couch. in the process of said visit, i had many drinks and became intoxicated (all too typical of a night, believe me i recognize now it's a problem). when headed back to my friend's place to tuck in for the night, i walked in the door and to the right of it immediately when you walk in is a statue of george washington with a detachable head. 

having had a few many drinks i had decided that i was going to put this head on it's body and slap the statue around a bit. eventually that escalated to a point in which in my drunken stupor, thinking it would look cool, i proceeded to take the head outside and smash it on the pavement (a giant **** and **** move on my part).

unbeknownst to me at the time however this statue was the property of my friend's roommate, and it turns out it was one of the few items handed down to him from his dad. i am not sure what it would be valued at in the market, but i know this guy values it highly and i ruined it. i now feel like the world's biggest **** and tool, but want to try to find some way to make it up to the guy (if that is even possible). 

 

despite any restitution agreement the two of us come to, i would like to replace the head if at all possible so at the very least he can keep the statue on display. i would hope that between that and any other agreements we come to, he and his family can be at peace. i'm posting this here because i can't find anything on this statue and was wondering if anyone can here help me identify a replacement for the head in this [picture](http://imgur.com/qxztjgf).

first a little background information: two years ago my family and i celebrated christmas in the states (we're from europe). and my dad and i are big fans of disney and have always wanted a glorious tree with bright colors and lights in green, blue, red and yellow, and you can't really get them where i'm from. so of course we had to buy some when we were in the states, and buy some i mean around 200 of them. 

anyways: come yesterday and my brother and i are decorating the tree. we start with the lights (as always), and when we have put them up we realize we need an electrical transformer. no problem, we bought one in the states and i take charge for fixing the right settings. i thought it shouldn't be that difficult and it wasn't. soon enough the tree was brightly shining in 4 different colors. as we continued the decoration of the tree my brother pointed out that the lights were getting a little hot. i thought nothing of it really. until 2 hours later. thats when all the lights one after one died pretty fast and they wouldn't turn on again. turns out in the us you use 110v, but i had plugged it in at 220v burning them all out... so no disney tree this christmas. my mom is happy because she thought the lights were horrible.",made my mom happy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

quick background- 
  my girlfriend and i met when i first moved to a new area several years ago (closer to 10 than five).  not long after meeting, i was laid off from my job.  by the time we knew we would get married we felt like we needed to be more financially stable before taking the next step.  
  we have now purchased a home together in a new area, and are getting things moving in the right direction.  last weekend while discussing future plans, marriage came up.  i asked her if she ""had any plans next weekend"", and she said ""no"".  it was at that moment i asked her how she would feel about having her anniversary on 12-13-15.  
surprise factor = 100
romance factor = zero

here is where the tifu happens:
because of the short notice, the two of us looked at it as being a legal procedure.  none of our parents live in our state, and we're not religious.  our plan is to meet a few of my relatives and friends who live nearby, and we would get married in a park.  then, next year we would have a planned ceremony and reception for all of our friends and family.
problem is, we are the only two who looked at it this way.  a number of people feel left out, and my mom was very hurt.  had i realized how important this would have been for everyone else, i wouldn't have waited until the last minute to confirm the date.

 

edit*left the last t off of thought.

edit 2- we would have been happy if all those interested in attending could make it but my procrastination didn't leave much time to make plans for the specific day we wanted to marry.

those who didn't make it still sent love, wished us well, and were fully supportive.  they just would have liked to be there too.",thought family/friends would be more interested in the celebration of getting married than the formality of the legal act.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so, last night i walk upstairs and see my mom on her computer. i say hi to her but she doesn't respond and seems focused on the computer and annoyed/unhappy. i ignore it and go to the kitchen to make some food(10 feet away), when a few minutes later she tells me she thinks i accidentally left my dropbox logged in on her computer. oh ****, all my phone's pictures are automatically synced as soon as they are taken. she went to dropbox.com to log into her account to look at the baby pictures i shared, but i was still logged in. i ask how much she went through and she said not much, she was just looking for the baby pictures (the baby pics were towards te top). she lied...when i take the computer to log out i see she is all the way down to sept. 2011, and dropbox has the pictures in chronological order.

so my family and me had gone on holiday to germany to visit my uncle's new house which he has just finished renovating. 

one day he was out at work and we were in his house with his girlfriend. suddenly my mum screams and we all go over and there's this big green bug. i kind of walk away once i realise it's not anything major and leave everyone else to it. 

i then see my uncle's girlfriend go into a drawer in the kitchen and bring out a bottle of pepper spray (it's probably good to mention that we live in the uk and pepper spray is illegal there so we hadn't ever seen it before). she then goes upstairs and hands the bottle to my mum. 

i follow and start to think this might not be a great idea. anyway, the bug was on the stairs and we were all at the bottom except for my mum who was closer to the top near the bug. she then points it at the bug and sprays. 

as it turns out, pepper spray is red and all the walls were white. when she sprayed it, it was like paint being sprayed on the wall. it was red and went quite a bit on the wall.

we then all realised we had made a big mistake. as we start talking about what to do we all start to cough violently. pepper spray can also travel through the air. we all run down to the ground floor and think we have escaped the air. for a while, it held true. approximately 30 seconds. we then had to open all the doors and windows and we were coughing and our eyes were starting to stream.

then i had an idea! what would happen if tumpy ate the thumbtack? this is where i truly **** up. i told her that thumbtacks were actually just pointy candy and that she should try it. tumpy trusted me enough to eat it and when she did, she emitted the loudest screech of pain i've ever heard in my life. she dragged her legs across the ground and charged into the other main living room area where everyone else was seated, knocking over lego structures that the kids made. now she's screeching, the kids are crying, the pie is getting burned and everyone is frantic and freaking out. 

that's when tumpy opened her mouth and everyone sees a thumbtack stuck down the side of her throat. using tweezers, they remove it, and lecture her not to eat sharp or unknown objects. then, she pointed at me. everyone's head turned to face me, glaringly. tumpy shouted ""he didhg told eatttttughhhh"". i shrugged and told them i had no idea what she was indicating and they believed me.

two days ago, my father passed away from heard diseases (don't smoke, kids). all of us were gathered around his deathbed as he slipped away. before he left us, he asked us to write down his final words and wishes. he ended up saying a lot, confessing to kissing one of my mothers friends decades ago at a party, among other things, and even recalling his days from the war fighting in south east asia (things he had never told us about). i had the best handwriting in the family, so i was tasked with writing this all down. i quickly scrambled all pens and papers i could find. i found one pen. looked like an ordinary pen. once he had finished talking, he closed he just lay there and stayed awake for another 10 minutes, before passing away. 


the next day, my mother (grieving) asked to see what i had written (i actually filled out 1 and a half pages with writing). i told her to look for the paper in the kitchen. feeling emphatic, i decided to get it myself. this is when i realized the ****. two pieces of empty paper, next to my trusty disappearing ink pen. my mom's pretty ****, but she's more sad then she is ****. i've been hitting myself since then. probably gonna drink myself to sleep again tonight. hope to stop tomorrow.

we were at the park, me playing basketball with my dad and the rest of our family at the picnic table, until the clouds started forming. we thought nothing of it and continued to go on with our game. then the rain started dropping and it was starting to rain even harder when we got to our car. this is when problems started happening.

i had ridden my bicycle to the park because it couldn't fit into our car and i had my phone with me. my dad had volunteered to ride the bike home in the rain since he was used to it. (it rained in the city he lived in a lot) he headed off, but there was a problem. 

the car was completely refusing to move. we had tried every solution but it wouldn't budge, even if we tried changing gears. we were panicky and tried calling after my dad, but he had already gone off. we tried texting him, but he had left his phone in the car. ****. my mother and sister said that *i* should go run after him in the hellstorm that we were experiencing right now.

in spite of my apparent emotional retardation, i am very musically inclined, so he asked me from the front of the funeral home to come up and sing amazing grace. i was walking from my obligatory seat in the back of the room and was determined to behave with dignity. however, as i reached the front of the room, i tripped over a rogue wire and face-planted in front of the podium/stage area.

seeing how i was already feeling awkward, tripping and falling only compounded the uncomfortable situation i was in. i attempted to diffuse the situation and make fun of myself (before too many people could get up to help me) by quickly hopping to my feet and loudly singing out ""another one bites the dust! another one bites the dust... and another one gone, and another one gone....""

i heard my mom's voice in my mind, ""if all your friends jumped off a cliff would you do it too?""  but the devil on my other shoulder told me that as long as i didnt let it fill with maggots, or drill it to small, or slice my **** on the pullout i would be fine. boy was i wrong.

i grabbed a spare coconut from a decorative fruit bowl, and begun drilling with a knife and a twisting motion. i lubed up and begun the time old ritual of coconut fornication. 

now, this whole process was quite loud and i was negligent to the fact that my family was still home, but by the time i realized this it was too late. 

whooosh 

the door swung open with such speed that i couldn't react. there was no warning and because of the little **** i am freaked the **** out and ripped it off my manhood faster than a bullet.

""what the fuck"" my mom said while seeing me throw a coconut off my bleeding ****. before i could say anything the shut the door and hasn't said a word to me since. this just happened, wish me luck guys.

 


edit: obligatory obligatory holy **** this blew up! i am now known as a coconut **** by about 47 thousand people. maybe i could use that as leverage to get adopted faster.....",somehow convinced myself that following in the footsteps of my coconut fucking brethren was a good idea and i'm now probably going up for adoption soon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,438,part3,family,tldr,buying a washing machine and then taking it directly to the dump.,5,4,0.75,5,"our washing machine died on the weekend. searching kijiji, i saw a used front end loading machine for $30. stupidly, i believed the guy who said it just shook too much and made noise, but could be easily repaired. the only time he was available was before 8:00 am, so i had to get it on my way to work. it was a beast to load into the suv. when i googled the repair for this particular samsung model, it was obvious that the main support bracket was a worthless piece of **** which corroded away on almost every one of these poorly designed samsung lemons. it was apparently extremely difficult to get at, requiring complete disassembly. only an idiot would buy one. rather than take it home, lug it into the basement and explain to my family why i was embarking on a three-month repair project, i drove past my house after work, straight to the dump, and heaved it into the metal recycling pile. i kept a hose as a reminder of my stupidity. but i do hope the seller, who is in the hvac repair business and must have known the real problem, suffers the bad karma he deserves.","this morning i bought a cheap used washing machine, and then, with one simple search, learned it was almost certainly a useless piece of shit, so i took it straight to the dump. didn't even bother looking at it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

p.s.- she texts me the next day and says that she has always secretly though of messing around with me.",fooled around with roommates gf and possibly ruined a lot of things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,441,part3,family,tldr,blowing up my grandmothers computer power supply.,9,6,0.8700000048,9,"so this actually happened more than a decade ago. for context, my mom is working as an accountant, and since she wanted to buy a better computer for work, she had a spare pc to give away, so we thought it would be a great idea to give it to our grandmother since she was really fascinated about the social media and she really wanted to get into it at that time. (facebook went worldwide, youtube launched, etc.) since the computer was slow, i was given a task to clean the computer so it is more stable and usable. so i thought to reinstall the computer with windows xp, the only problem was that i didn't have a original license so i pirated the os and burned it on a dvd. and then, the fun begins. i was dealing with many issues, particularly this one - https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/xpsetupnohd.png i was so desperate to get rid of the issue, i tried messing around in the bios settings, nothing worked. a little note here as well that i was not the smartest with computers at that time as well. anyways, i tried turning the computer around to check if everything is all right with the ports, and i noticed this red switch on the power supply, example here - https://fthmb.tqn.com/6ytm04br07llphg_ya8r5dtimzk=/768x0/filters:no_upscale()/sentey-xpp-series-psu-56a6fa135f9b58b7d0e5cdf5.jpg what the switch does, is that it changes the power supply voltage since countries all around the world can have different voltage requirements. but, since i didn't know jack **** about computers, i switched it out of desperateness. after couple seconds, i heard some weird scratching noises in the power supply and then bang! **** smoke comes out of it, i run and i plug the cable and i open as much windows as possible to get rid of the smell. i was so scared but also relieved that i was alone so nobody saw the mess i did. after the chaos, i made a dumb excuse that it is impossible to reinstall the os to my family, and luckily they bought my ****. but at least after months, my grandmother saved up for her own laptop so at least a somewhat happy ending for her!","wanted to reinstall my grandmother's computer, but due to issues and lack of knowledge, i switched the voltage switch on the power supply and bang, after it, smokes comes out, and i pull the plug.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

i work as a computer repair tech in a retail chain, and sometimes aside from actually fixing things have to answer questions over the phone. i don't particularly mind doing so aside the mild distraction it causes in my work. anyway- a gentleman reaches me by phone with questions about a printer he wants to purchase. this all goes straightforward, questions answered, features confirmed, ect. the guy is very nice which is sometimes rare for me to encounter, and he's so pleased with me he asks for my name. i then proceed to complicate things.

i often am called only by my last name, and so frequently i tell people to call me it, or tell them it's my first name (it's fairly unique and as i have associates that use this site i'd rather not share). most people just roll with it, but when, just to save explaination i tell this person it's my first, he questions it abit. ""yep!"" i stupidly say, prompting him to ask my last name. i had not planned on that evidently, and in spite of any common sense i blurt out that my last name is 'jeans' off the top of my head.. yeah, incredibly convincing i know.

the disbelief in his tone was obvious, and we goodbye'd and all, but now i'm left with a perfectly nice guy who either already knows i lied and probably now distrusts my information. or, even optimistically will certainly mention my lovely surname to someone and find out he's been lied to. so i feel awful/foolish.","helped nice person, told him a fake name for reasons unknown.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,444,part3,family,tldr,wiping,21,12,0.8100000024,21,"folks, i have a tale to teach you what not to do on a hot day. 

i've been in north america (note: brit alert) for around a week and a half on holiday with my family, visiting new york city, toronto and i am currently in dc, which is incredibly hot and humid at the moment, especially for a sorry old englishman like myself. it's been fantastic so far - as a history buff and with a keen eye for politics it's been a goldmine of interesting things. today, however, we decided to take a break from the museums and monuments to go to the washington zoo, which i was very excited for. 

so we're there, having a great time seeing the giant pandas (never seen them before anywhere) and the plethora of other animals. whilst walking around in ~30° (90° for the yanks) heavy heat, naturally i began to precipitate in various areas of my body. as a chubbier fellow it does become a bit of a bother, most notably in the rear area. 

as the wetness between the cheeks increases, so does my appetite to fix the issue. what does one do? ahah! a good old wipe! the perfect solution. so in the amazonian section i take to the restrooms where i intend to perform the procedure. 

i lock the stall door, finally ready to rid myself of this plaguing discomfort. the shorts come down and i triumphantly tear lots of toilet paper and give it a good ol swipe. again, and again, and again - until my crack is as dry as the sahara. i feel like a new man as i return to my family...

suddenly on the walk out of the toilets, a soreness rushes from my bottom. the dreaded word - chaffing. every step i take is like a thousand lashes to the bumcheeks, the discomfort multiplies by 20 from before. never before have i wished so much for a wetness down there. the worst part - we still had more than half of the zoo left to see. so the rest of the day was spent very slowly shifting around in the intense heat, just begging for my **** crack to sweat, but it wouldn't. it was torturous, and now my **** is as raw as the sushi i had for dinner.","no matter how uncomfortable and moist it gets - never, *ever* wipe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,445,part3,family,tldr,shoveling snow,6,0,0.8000000119,6,"yesterday i spent the afternoon clearing my in-laws front yard of snow. once the yard was finished, we began working on the front porch. 

this is a typical north-eastern chinese farmhouse and in the winter, they add plastic sheeting to the front over a wooden frame to create a sort of sun room. it looks like a green house attached the house. 

anyway, i was clearing away all the ice and snow that had accumulated at the base of the plastic and was so careful not to puncture the plastic sheeting with the shovel. we got it all done in a couple hours and i thought, ""great. got some exercise. helped the in-laws.""

fast-forward a few hours. it's about 11:00-11:30 pm chinese new year's eve. time to set off fireworks. lit the fuse, ran back to the porch to watch. i'm looking up at the explosions in the sky when i feel a burst behind me. and then another. we couldn't understand why we felt these bursts behind us until the mother-in-law and the family cat come running out of the porch enclosure. two of the fireworks decided to shoot straight toward the house instead of up in the sky. after investigating, we find the very spot where i had cleared off the ice and snow just hours before had two fresh holes from the rogue fireworks. 

based on the amount of ice and snow there, we could probably have avoided the holes in the wall if it had still been there.",cleared ice from wall of plastic sheeting. set off fireworks which shot through the now clear wall.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i work as a waiter so normally i don't have to deal with the sort of thing that i had to deal with today.

today one of our bussers lost it and quit, and the other busser that was working at the same time freaked out and quit as well, so we were at lunch rush with nobody cleaning tables or doing any of the small jobs around the restaurant.

we ran our of root beer. ****. the manager asked me to change to pop, so naturally i think this can't be too hard. we keep the 20l boxes of pop syrup in a shelf above the managers desk. the box says don't open with a knife, but i'm feeling pretty highly of myself and i go for it. 

****. **** **** **** ****. i pierced the bag sending 20l of root beer syrup all over my managers computer, printer, keyboard, and phone. 

i couldn't breathe. i freaked the **** out. i closed the door turned off the light and went straight to the change room to take off my uniform. i left it right there in the bathroom, went straight home and blocked the work number. 

 

**update**: still no call from my manager. no house visitations and such. ex coworkers have reached out to me on facebook asking where i've been and if i did it. i chose not to read not reply to the messages. today was my first day at mcdonalds and i watched a bunch of **** safety videos. ironically they told me not to open the bags of ice cream mix with a knife. i have an ominous feeling that you folks haven't seen the last of me.",i now work at mcdonalds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

long story short, i got wasted, was being obnoxious and yelled at my boyfriend to feed me. he puts tomato soup in the mic and nukes it. i like my soup extra hot and defintiely let him know this. anyway went to grab soup from boyfriend off a flimsy paper plate, plate flips and spills boiling hot tomato bisque soup all over my yoga pants right on my thighs and lady parts. i scream, jump up, soup goes all the way down my legs in super tight yoga pants and sticks to me. first instinct, take pants off now. fire burning lava pants. but my boyfriend had a friend over. i flail screaming andy sandberg style to the bathroom and try to peel off the pants almost melted to my skin. 
was too **** to realize the full damage (that comes the next day). i go back into my room, scream this is all my boyfriends fault and demand for him to take me home now because this, again, is all his fault. i was trashed, gathered my things, boyfriend drops me off. i fall outta the car and spill my purse in front of my house but am too booze brained to even register it. i kept my boyfriends spare id in my purse and i wrote in huge sharpie between his name ""big **** boyfriendslastname"". its a novelty of sorts. forgot it the next day and my dad found it. it's a family joke now. 
the cherry on the cake was waking up the next day to the damage i had done. my underwear were stained red with tomato soup. my upper thighs, female parts, and lower stomach, and streams down my legs and forearms were super, super burned with some blisters.i had blisters in the shape of the splash on my belly, too. i didn't realize it until i went to the bathroom and felt like i had super sun burn on my ****.

so anyone, one day she comes into the store [this is random, because we usually just ship it to them].

at this point, my dad is manning the register while i am stocking up the shelves. 

and she tells us about a ""business"" in which you log on to a website, do nothing of note for a few mins each day, provide your personal details, and basically you collect points and you will be rewarded based upon the points. apparently she had been doing this for a month+ now and just needed to log on for another month before collecting a huge reward.

she was going to link us up where we sign up which will give her a bonus 100 points. my dad stated that this was interesting and she should send us a link. 

at this point i blurted out that this was a scam. 

she looked at me like i had engaged in ethnic cleansing, and then starts arguing with me, at which point i state the obvious facts, and why this is clearly a scam, all the while my dad is motioning for me to shut up. 

this discussion continues for around 3-4 minutes by the end of which she started screaming about how we can't recognize a good business opportunity and all our supplies dont work and we lie about the products and what not. 

all the while there is a guy coming into the door who hears everything, and leaves. she also leaves and we have yet to receive an order from that company since. also, she was a referral by another owner who i assume is not going to be pleased about this.","so basically i was in my dad's small business store selling business supplies.

because of this, i've developed a bit of a crush on him. he's super nice and selfless, and not terrible looking. he came out to me about a month ago, telling me he thinks he's **** and asking advice, and that only strengthened my desires for him. 

it's now winter break and i haven't seen him in a week. we've kept in casual conversation, nothing too heavy. i've told my home friends of my feelings for him, so the other day i snapchatted a picture of his facebook profile picture to a few friends with the caption ""how could you not fall for this cutie?""

i accidentally sent it to my roommate as well. 

i quickly realized my mistake and proceeded to attempt to cover my **** by sending him more snapchats, zooming in on his face and saying creepier things about him, finally ending with a shot of just his eyes and the caption ""he's watching you."" 

he texted me with a screenshot of all the notifications saying ""u good bro?"" ""hahahaha"" and i replied with ""yeah idek."" luckily, we're both a little eccentric and i hoped he wouldn't think twice about it. we proceeded to have a pretty serious (but short) conversation, and we've talked a few times since then. 

i still can't tell if he caught on or not. 

my biggest fear is that he'll get weirded out because i like him and live with him and that our friendship will suffer. i'm currently leaning towards not pursuing a relationship with him (because we're roommates and that might complicate things), but i'd still like to maintain the good friendship we developed.","so i started college this year and went with a random roommate instead of finding someone on facebook. we didn't talk much over the summer, but we got along pretty well when we met on the first day of orientation. as the semester went along, we became really close and really good friends. he's probably the best friend i've made at school. we're just really compatible and we offer a lot to each other.

,466,part3,relationship,documents,catching the garter at my friend's wedding,16,3,0.8999999762,16,"this happened last weekend. first post.

 
i've been dating my girlfriend for 7 years now and for those of you who are (or have been) at that dating stage, you start to get a lot of the ""when are you getting married"" questions. constantly. especially at weddings.

 
side note: my friend's husband's brother jack (long relationship explanation, i know), who is also the best man, was in an accident a couple years back that left him paralyzed from the waist down. his family has taken care of him since the accident, and as you can imagine it has been quite a transition and a blow to the family.

 
anyway, we're having a good time and partying like you do at a wedding when they call the bouquet and garter tosses. for those of you who may not know, any female not married usually goes out on the floor to catch the bouquet and if they do they're supposed to get married next. it is the same for men with the garter toss. my girlfriend doesn't catch it and everyone gives her **** because we've been dating so long.

 
now it's the men's turn. no **** around. i'm going out there, and i am not leaving without the garter. i don't know why it seemed like it was such a big deal at the time, but i really wanted to get it. for the sake of chivalry? possible. some deep-seeded issue with my self confidence that i thought catching a sweaty garter would fix? probable.

 
all the dudes line up and the groom fires the garter in the air. it's headed slightly right. i have to lean slightly... boom! i caught that ****. i felt like the man...

 
until i look behind me. and lock eyes with the groom's parapalygic brother jack. and realize the garter would have fallen in his lap, and to everyone else it looked like i intercepted the garter from the wheelchair-bound best man at the last second.

 
i am pretty sure i will never be able to look at my friend's husband fred or his brother jack ever, and will cringe until the day i die thinking back on this night... the night i stole from a dude in a wheelchair.","this happened last weekend. first post.

my day started well, favorite breakfast, lunch at the street corner on my work, and dinner with friends and family. now as i lay in my bed, my phone beeps for an alarm for my birthday with a letter attachment to it. i wrote myself a letter last year of the things i should do, adventures i should take, lessons i need to learn etc. as i go through the letter i can’t help but notice that i almost accomplished all of those things on the letter.  except for my biggest fu.

i told myself to stop dating different girl every month and just focus on one. and i did. i met her, and with her i am me, no holding back, no lies, not pretending, i am just me. last year was an amazing year because i have her. then i fu. i broke up with her because i got cold feet and i thought we were going too fast and we are going serious too soon. 

now that it is my birthday, i never felt alone. yes, i have my family but i have an estranged relationship with all of them. i have my friends who i met through games but i they never understand the real me. i had her, nothing else matter except her but i lost her because my 25 year old me broke up with her one sunny wednesday thinking it is the right thing to do. of course the player in me, ignore all her calls, and texts, and never answer the door to even just talk. 

if i could go back to fall of last year, i would kick myself in the balls, or i would even touch habanero peppers then remove my contacts and **** without even washing my hands to learn my lesson. 

i never felt so alone, so on my birthday, i hope you guys learn from my lesson. it’s ok to be afraid, to get scared, to feel overwhelmed, because of the end of the day, you have that someone and the feeling being loved is the greatest feeling of all.

anyways fast forward to new years this year. we find me and her out for dinner because i still cared about her and had no other plans that night. we see a movie, and head back home to my place, things go to fourth base from there. anyways the entire month of january i've spent contemplating how much i miss her, and need her in my life. so fast forward again  to this past week. she asks if she should move on forever or if she should wait for me. i tell her to move on and be happy cause i'm not sure yet. saturday comes, she tells me she has a boyfriend as i'm about to confess my feelings for her (somewhat of a fu on my part there).

things get emotional, and we talk and cry as former lovers do. we come to yestersay,  with her having to pick between him and me, i decided to head to her house to convince her. before i get there, i decided to buy some flowers. however, never having ordered professional flowers, i asked the lady at the counter for the presentation package, thinking that it was your typical bouquet. this was the fanciest damned flowers i've ever laid eyes on. the kind of flowers that you buy your wife after a big fu. it's those kind of flowers.

so comes time to pay (they took half an hour to assemble said flowers). the lady tells me ""alright that will be $78.39 sir"". me, thinking i could use these beautiful roses to win the love of my life back says,  ""sure!"". i'm sitting here this morning, still single and heartbroken.","so this happened over the course of yesterday to this morning. a little backstory to offer some explanation to this fu. recently i've been trying to get back with my ex (we'll call her sam) with whom i broke up with in july 2015. the reasons in a nutshell why we broke up were my fault, because i lead myself to thinking that she was the reason for me being unhappy. this wasn't the case as i was the one who was not being communicative in the relationship and she was willing to work things out till the end.

,475,part3,relationship,documents,changing my bedsheets.,10,2,0.9200000167,10,"this actually happened two weeks ago, although it was today that i learned of the effects it had.

i had been in a weekend relationship since february. my now ex girlfriend lives some 130 km (80 miles) away, so we visited each other each friday to sunday. she came here two weeks ago, so i changed the bedsheets on thursday. i hadn't used those sheets for almost a year, when i was still living with my last girlfriend. i didn't even think about it and slept happily in those sheets that night.

the next day my girlfriend arrives, i pick her up, we have dinner, talk a bit and go to bed at night. action begins, when she suddenly stops and pulls a long, blonde hair from my **** (she has short, dark hair). i only say ""where the **** did that come from?"" and don't waste a second thought about it. action continues.

after leaving that sunday, she begins to behave distantly, doesn't answer messages for hours and says she has a lot of work, so she can't join me next (that is, last) weekend on a little trip to visit some friends (first weekend we didn't spend together). i played along till friday, when her answers began to get truly short. so i didn't message her until she wrote me on sunday evening. 

of course i noticed that something was odd, and when she wrote that she preferred to come here instead of me visiting her, i knew what would happen. so this afternoon she arrives in my town, we sit on a bench and she says that this isn't working, that we have differences, that we should split. she also brings up the hair in my ****, suggesting that i was being unfaithful. i was baffled: that **** hair hadn't been on my mind for two weeks and suddenly it is the main reason why we're splitting up. i tried explaining, but heck, *i'd* probably think the same were it the other way round.

anyway, i told the girl that i was ok with splitting up, because it's true, we're very different on many levels; but that she please should not think it was because i slept with another girl. she only replied: ""well, either way it doesn't matter anymore.""","this actually happened two weeks ago, although it was today that i learned of the effects it had.

i've only been driving for a year and a half. ever since i got my license, i've been the taxi for my brother.

so last friday, i had to take him to work. as usual, i had about 5 minutes to get him there due to him dragging his feet getting ready. everything goes smoothly until i get to the turn for the street where his work is. it was a green light but no green arrow. there's a car in front of me, pulled up and waiting to turn, so i pull up behind them. the oncoming traffic stops to let people turn. guy in front of me turns, so i stupidly follow behind and just as i'm nearly around the corner, dude comes up the left hand oncoming lane and thumps me in the left headlight.

yay first accident. now i'm on the hook for maybe over $1000 (find out tomorrow how much the other guy is quoted for fixing his panels. i'm hoping that because he came away with mostly scratches on the front and a couple of slightly popped panels that he put back in place before he left, it'll be cheap.)

oh, and my parents have gone back to being really unimpressed with me. any small amount of good vibes i might have earned over the last few months is now gone. that'll really improve our not so great relationship.","more like last friday though.

a little background story: i met this girl online and dated her for 2-3 weeks before breaking up. never met her, still haven’t and don’t plan on doing so and all my friends know about this. 

 i was having spanish class and she being the cool teacher she is, she decides to stop class 20-30 minutes earlier and asks about our lives. she goes around the class and asks us questions. 

my turn, great. ""mr. /u/barra420, do you have a girlfriend?"" i answer, ""i used to"" she then asks what happened. (i met this girl online and started dating her without ever meeting her, yeah i know, what the ****) i proceed to tell her the story of how i met her and she goes batshit crazy. “so you mean you dated this girl that for all you know could be a man? how do you know she wasn’t a **** or something like that? should i talk to the school counselor?” all those types of questions.

i start explaining myself, every single guy in the class by now is laughing their brains off. the girls look at me like i just **** on the bible and waved a confederate flag in front of a black priest.

guess you can say i have a long year forward with her bringing my online girlfriend up all the time.

 

edit: didn't date her, i talked to her, nothing serious, never told her i loved her or anything. i just say we dated because there isn't a word to describe our relationship.","this happened 3 days ago.
a little background story: i met this girl online and dated her for 2-3 weeks before breaking up. never met her, still haven’t and don’t plan on doing so and all my friends know about this. 

 i was having spanish class and she being the cool teacher she is, she decides to stop class 20-30 minutes earlier and asks about our lives. she goes around the class and asks us questions. 

my turn, great. ""mr. /u/barra420, do you have a girlfriend?"" i answer, ""i used to"" she then asks what happened. (i met this girl online and started dating her without ever meeting her, yeah i know, what the fuck) i proceed to tell her the story of how i met her and she goes batshit crazy. “so you mean you dated this girl that for all you know could be a man? how do you know she wasn’t a pedo or something like that? should i talk to the school counselor?” all those types of questions.

i start explaining myself, every single guy in the class by now is laughing their brains off. the girls look at me like i just shit on the bible and waved a confederate flag in front of a black priest.

the day was going sweet, i spent all day drilling and fitting the frame, cleaning, painting and generally doing a great job. 

half hour before we’re due to finish up for the day everyone had assembled back at the workshop, including the boss, the last thing to do was to lift the big plastic tank onto the truck using our crane truck, which is basically a big truck with all the things you could ever need to do our work along with an expensive palfinger crane (for those who are interested)

anyway while we’re manoeuvring everything into position i have to lower the tank to re adjust a sling, the controls for the crane are at the side of the truck and we’re lifting directly over the front of the cab, so i’m relying a lot on two other guys to make sure everything’s going to plan. 

all of a sudden as i’m lowering it to the ground i here a crunch and see shards of glass falling on the floor. my heart sank, all the days work fell apart in a second. from great day to potentially $150,000 bill which i take full responsibility for as i was on the controls.

happy hump day, fingers crossed it’s not a right off. sorry for the bad grammar, i’m two cones down and beers my homey tonight.

how one bad decision leads to another. i've been ill for a while, haven't been sleeping or eating properly either but decide to drink.  want to drink cocktails , thought given recent drinking times i'd be fine and controlled.
nope, i ended up a wasted state.
have been in love with my close friend for years (who i'll just call 'a'),  but i am in a relationship with his best friend (have been for years). this is an open secret however and it is also known that a has feelings for another close friend  of mine ('b'). i also know a used to have feelings for me. of recent, a had been a total **** to me repeatedly so i was already feeling wound up. my frustrations were with him being a shity friend but obviously given the situation it is hard not to and can be justified to jump to the conclusion that his shittiness is due to our past.
so this cocktail of bad decisions is then tested by seeing a give b lots of special treatment and fawning. b has no interest in a and i feel like a is being disrespectful to me by his actions. other close friends bring up with me frequently how a's actions to b are weird and obvious as well as a's actions to me are obvious. should point out that a being so overt is really unusal and he's not had a girlfriend in all the time i've known him or any romantic entanglements besides that i've mentioned.  
so, something in me has snapped and what do i do in my drunken tequila induced state and do not remember? i want to make a hurt how i hurt, so i start slinging really vicious insults about b to a. i said some awful things , words i'd never use otherwise and not even used to describe people i don't actually even like.
a has thrown a drink on me, i attempted to physically retaliate, b has overheard all the horrible **** i have said.

our story starts with my boyfriend's mom taking us and his older brother out for dinner. at this point, we hadn't been together very long so i had never really socialized with his family before. i had maybe, in total, said 10 words to them at this point in our relationship and this was my chance to break out of my socially awkward and quiet shell and try to make some small talk. well, during dinner i failed miserably and mostly sat on my hands and occasionally piped in a short comment or two. 

soon enough the meal was over and my boyfriend (let's call him travis) got behind the wheel to drive us all back to his house, his mom in the passenger seat, and his brother and i sitting in the back. they chit chatted and i stayed quiet until i noticed the air freshener above my head. it was labeled in big letters ""black ice"". so i took this as my chance to strike up conversation.

""huh, i didn't know black ice had a smell"" i said. now, i'm a quiet person by nature, and travis's car is a big monster of a truck complete with loud engine, not to mention we were on a bustling loud road. so i guess it was not the easiest thing to clearly hear what i said because the reaction they had to my statement was mortifying. somehow, they had all misheard me and thought i said ""black guys"" instead of ""black ice""..... somebody shoot me in the **** head now. 

it didn't take long to clarify the misunderstanding, and they all laughed about it when i explained what i meant.....but still mortifying. this is what i get for trying to not be a silent stranger to my so's family...","so this didn't happen today but i thought reddit might enjoy my embarrassing story because hell, who doesn't like hearing about embarrassing shit that happens to other people?

one monday morning, one of the senior rm's had a business trip to ny later that day so he brought his suitcase to the office. this was it, this was my chance. i waited for him to leave for lunch and proceeded to empty his suitcase and replaced everything with some phonebooks, worthless documents, empty folders, etc. i had double thoughts, but i remember him saying he was only going to be in ny for a couple of days to attend a corporate seminar.

he came back from lunch, gathered his things and went down for a cab. it was too late now.. i honestly hoped for him to notice before leaving or close to, leaving enough for me to just re-pack his bag. nope. he sped off in a cab and i didn't hear anything about it until thursday.

i get called into my boss's office early, and see the sr. rm sitting there mad as ****. i could tell he would have killed me had it not been frowned upon. he ""politely"" rips me apart and mentions how he had a last minute due dillingence meeting for a bond issuance with one of his most important multinational clients which he was late for after having to buy an entire new outfit (suit, shirt, tie, etc.).

long story short, this extremely idiotic prank ended up costing me 800 bucks and months worth of evil eyes from other rm's. it obviously got better over time and we all joked about it for the rest of my time there.

,599,part3,relationship,documents,"not thinking before i speak, and letting my girlfriend know how i really feel",1,10,0.5,1,"so, as per usual, this didn't happen today, it happened about...7 years ago.

a little context: i'm a musician, mainly a guitarist. i'm a bit of a gearhead, and love shiny new toys.

i was living with my girlfriend at the time, in our first apartment (my first time living away from home, as i'd stayed at home during college). at this point, i had already earned a reputation for saying the wrong thing without thinking. it kind of runs in the family, as my dad and brother are just as bad. nothing intentionally mean, we just say things, and then realize how they sound immediately afterwards. 

i had recently purchased a new-to-me guitar, and was still in the honeymoon phase. i was obsessing over it, and talking about how great it was. my girlfriend made the joke of ""oh, i bet you want to have **** with it.""

without thinking, my mind still on the guitar, i got a kind of disgusted look on my face and responded with:

""no. i respect it too much.""

it's down to how our relationship was (at the time) and how well she knew me that she was mostly **** with me, and enjoying watching me squirm, as she knew that i didn't really mean it like that. 

i wish i could say my backpedalling was skillful and resolved things perfectly.

""no, no, no! i don't mean like that! i mean, it's not *made* for that!""

we're no longer together, but it's not as a result of this incident (we stayed together another 2 years after that and were happy for a good portion of that).","so, as per usual, this didn't happen today, it happened about...7 years ago.

a little context: i'm a musician, mainly a guitarist. i'm a bit of a gearhead, and love shiny new toys.

i was living with my girlfriend at the time, in our first apartment (my first time living away from home, as i'd stayed at home during college). at this point, i had already earned a reputation for saying the wrong thing without thinking. it kind of runs in the family, as my dad and brother are just as bad. nothing intentionally mean, we just say things, and then realize how they sound immediately afterwards. 

i had recently purchased a new-to-me guitar, and was still in the honeymoon phase. i was obsessing over it, and talking about how great it was. my girlfriend made the joke of ""oh, i bet you want to have sex with it.""

without thinking, my mind still on the guitar, i got a kind of disgusted look on my face and responded with:

""no. i respect it too much.""

do you remember the messages in your facebook feed about how cats take a nap in your engine block to hide from the cold, or even heat? i found out the hard way they're true. 

a little black cat (less than a year old) jumped out from under my car. she had a loosely dangling rear leg and several skin injuries. needless to say, the poor thing was scared out of her wits, not to mention in terrible pain. 

thankfully, an old lady in the street saw me comforting that cat while i was trying to reach several vets (none of whom were in office at that time). she pointed me to where the owners lived. 

so i rang them out of bed, and passed on a couple of the phone numbers i dialed. i'll go check in a few days to see if she's doing fine. 

accidents like this may be unavoidable, but i still felt guilt and responsibility.

i went by that house again last night to see what was up, but there was no good news to be told. apparently she had gotten a belly wound too. it wasn't immediately visible because it had been immediately scorched shut (and she had black fur too).

my girlfriend and i just moved into a house we bought off foreclosure.  now, most of the house was in good condition, but there was still a lot of work to be done.  we just finished painting everything, replacing the light fixtures, and are in the middle of getting new floors.  one thing we wanted was to have our tv over the fireplace, but when our cable provider sent someone out to hook up our cable he told us he couldn't put a cable outlet there unless we drilled the hole in the attic ourselves.

so fastforward a week and my gf's father decided to go drill a hole in the attic and run a cable through the wall to a new socket he made over the fireplace.  now, he is very good at things like this, but when it comes to electrical work (or anything involving electronics) he is fairly clueless, so when he started talking about how he still needed to run the phone line through the hole for our cable box i started to wonder just what he did.  

so last night i decided to climb up there and see just what he had done.  when i climbed up there and began crossing the attic i learned that the attic wasn't completed, that most of it had only a thin layer of sheetrock between me and the room below, so i stepped carefully to avoid denting the ceiling.  well, on my way back from seeing his work, my foot slipped.  next thing i know i'm hanging from the rafters with my foot wrapped up in a now twisted light fixture.  the light fixture saved me from falling completely, but now it's bent up really badly and there is a four square foot hole in the ceiling with insulation falling out.","so this technically happened last night, but after spending the rest of the night cleaning up and trying to fix the aftermath i only just now have time to post this.

the whole thing is controlled by a custom-made pressure plate connected to a battery and an electric solenoid that i have been working on and i was testing the pressure plate but it was not working quite correctly, so i went back into my apartment, leaving the fire poofer outside on the corner.

after a few minutes of drilling holes to attach ramps up onto the pressure plate, i asked my friend who was helping me to go outside to check on the fire poofer. (i live in san francisco and was concerned some homeless person might walk up and try to carry it away).

after a minute or two, when my friend didn't return, i went outside to check on what was up. as soon as i walk out the door, there are 20 cops including their commanding officer (a sergeant i think) all blocking off the street. they had caution tape going in all four directions and i walked up to them and asked what was going on. 

they asked me if the fire poofer was mine and i explained that it was and they asked me what the **** i was doing. i live across the street form a hospital and apparently someone had seen the propane tank sitting on the corner connected to a battery and called the bomb squad! 

they took my id and copied down my information and asked me to explain exactly what the **** i was doing. i walked them through step by step how it all works and showed them the video on my phone linked above. 

half of the cops laughed and said it was cool and were interested, the other half were **** off and wanted to search my apartment. in the end, they all just left and let me take my equipment back inside.

anyways i've had the ring and was just waiting for inspiration, found it and decided to move forward with my plan to turn this home into an everlasting christmas memory for her. 

i went out and spent some crazy money on christmas lights and other things (we previously lived with roommates and in an apartment and had nothing but a fake tree), i was going to fully deck out our new home in the most epic light show which would dwarf anything the street had...now here's the rub, our house has a metal roof and this winter has been warmer then usual so the snow was melting, in my infinite genius i throw on my dunlops(rubber work boots) and head up onto the roof to hang the lights, now the angle of the metal roof plus the melting snow and rubber boots made traversing a bit of a chore, not impossible  tho.

 i start hanging lights, finish the part that's away from the gutter (no problems) and reach over and start hanging the lights on the  gutter(the roofs to high for a ladder to reach) and suddenly i feel my body start skidding, i have just enough time to twist myself around so i'm going feet first instead of head first and i shoot off the edge of the house and slam into the ground,  ended up with a fractured pelvis spending christmas and new years in the hospital and am now useless for the next 5 months.","tifu so i get this bright idea to propose to my girlfriend just before christmas, it's one of her favourite holidays. this past year had been rough for us ( she suffered a stroke caused by birth control, i was laid off at one point ) regardless we powered ahead and bought a home together.

,618,part3,work,documents,drilling into my thumb,1,0,1,1,"this happend several days ago.
a friend and i were working on a project and this involved for me to drill a hole trough several quite large pieces of wood at the same time so there could be a dowel put through the wood.
so after about 5 hours of work i drilled another one of these holes but the different pieces of wood was cut on different angles so it was not possible to put clamps on them so i had to hold them in place by hand.
and you can think of the rest. 
i had to change the drillbit because the first one was not long enough and with the second one i put some pressure behind the drill and then i just 'went trough'. the thing was that my thumb covered the hole where the drillbit came out a little bit. 
a sudden pain. 
thankfully i didn't drop the drill. at first it didn't bleed but then with time it started. i put some paper towels on it and finished the job and went home after that. at home i cleaned and disinfected the wound and inspected it. 
so now i have three rather deep cuts in my thumb which now after a few days are dry and started to heel. and now i will allways remember to stop at the right time before getting tired or losing concentration.","this happend several days ago.

i wanted to clean the dirty fish bowl i keep my beta in and scooped the little guy out into a solo cup.

after i finished cleaning the bowl, pebbles, water and little tiki guy i was ready for him to enjoy.

i grabbed the solo cup and began pouring out the old gross water so it wouldn't mix with the clean and the fish got a little excited and swam toward the stream - flying out of the solo cup, into the sick and bouncing into the garbage disposal.

i could still see the guy and stared into the disposal in disbelief for a few minutes thinking ""how in the world do i deal with this?!""

i tried to reach into the disposal with my hand but my dad has told me that accidents happen with disposals so i got too freaked out to continue.

next, i grabbed my tweezers to pick him up and that definitely didn't work - fish really squirm.

finally, i tried to fling him out with a screwdriver but that was ineffective.

ended up turning the water on and running the disposal. rip.","this happened 2 days ago but worth the share.

every weekend, i went around my dads. on his house he had a fake fireplace with a bunch of candles around it. 

because of this, i became a bit of a pyromaniac and loved lighting and extinguishing them. 

there was a lighter left specifically for the candles, after a few months, the lighter was getting harder and harder to use.

one day, the lighter just doesn't work and my dad tells me it's probably empty.

now, you know that thing children do when see if there is water coming out of a hose pipe? yeah, that.

so here i am trying to light the lighter with it pointed right at my face and almost like magic, it lights and sends a big jet of flame right up my nose.

did you know that fire smells of pain? like the smell was actually pain. i can't describe it any other way, but the smell had the physical sensation of pain. also the smell of burning nose hair and skin.

needless to say, i couldn't smell anything for the next month.","like most stories, this happened a long time ago, i was about 8 at the time.

while my dad was on his second tour in afghanistan, my mom decided to take my little sister to the philippines to visit some relatives, leaving my brother and i by ourselves at home.

one late night, after browsing through endless youtube videos, i came across a video that pranked people on chatroulette by appearing as a famous celebrity such as justin bieber or drake. 
i figured out how to do it and made it so i appeared as wiz khalifa smoking on my webcam. after getting numerous hilarious reactions, i decided to call it a night.

i woke up the next morning and my dad ended up calling me through skype. i had forgotten the fact that i still had the video of wiz on my video feed and answered the video call with my dad. the video had no audio and my audio input was turned off so  i couldn't tell my dad it was fake. i tried switching it back during the call but he quickly hung up. i tried calling back but he didn't answer. i was freaking out at this point. 

he ended up calling my older sister at work and letting her know what's going on. he assumed that a random black guy, ""wiz khalifa"" had broken into our house and is smoking **** in our office. 
my older sister called me and asked me what the **** is going on. i explained to her and she told me that my uncle (retired cop) is on his way with a unit from the police station to check up on the house. 
i called my uncle and told him what was going on and then finally received a call from my dad.

i have an assignment that was due 9 days ago, but i'm useless so i just handed it in last night.

it's about 4am, and i'm recording said commentary, i must've re-done it about 30 times at this point, and stress levels were at an all time high. 


i would note that a lot of people had their last exam yesterday, and as such decided to go out and celebrate... students will be students, right?


i could hear my flat-mates being rowdy, and in my sleep deprived state, i lost my temper and shouted obscenities at them. they shut up... eventually.


ahhhh, the home stretch. i did one more take and nailed it. brilliant. let's get this bad boy submitted so i can get some well-earned sleep!


i woke up today, and decided to relive the **** that's kept me from sleep for so long. within 10 seconds i knew that i'd **** up, because the wording was different to the commentary i wanted to use... 4 minutes in it hit me like a ton of bricks... 


*""i decided to use a darker theme to make this floo- will you lot shut the ****, jesus christ!""*


those words will forever haunt me.

we spent an hour and half waiting for the instructor. in that time, my paperwork was processed and approved. everyone was so kind and trying to help me relax. i was finally called for the vehicle inspection, so out we went.

she asked for the car's insurance card. i got it out and handed it to her, all while exchanging small talk. suddenly she frowns and says it's expired. by a week. ****. i searched for a newer one but the five that were in the car were from two years ago.

i answer. a neighbor and her boyfriend were there. i had met several times prior (they actually gave me a free sam adams mug once, i believe. they won it at an event and the bf didn't want to bring it back to baltimore.

okay so i had an assignment draft due today. nothing big, just two pages but i decided i might as well staple it anyway, just in case it gets lost. 

i go to staple it and what do i find? my stapler is empty. no biggie, i'll just refill it. 

i go to close the stapler and my brilliant self thought it was a great idea to place my thumb where the staples come out. 

a few seconds later i feel a sharp pain on my thumb so i pull my hand away and with it comes the stapler. 

yes, friends. i stapled my thumb to the stapler. 

i lean over to my friend and quietly tell her that i have royally **** myself and, being the good friend she is, she yells across the library to our teacher that i have stapled my thumb. 

my teacher comes over and immediately starts panicking because i have a stapler attached to my thumb. she sends my friend and another teacher with me to the nurse. 

half way there the stapler detaches itself but there is still a staple imbedded in my thumb. 

we get to the nurse and she starts laughing at the sheer  ridiculousness of the situation. she gives me a bandaid and some dettol and tells me to pull it out. 

i grab the staple and pull. immediately blood starts pouring out of the tiny holes because if how deep the staple had gone in. i wipe the blood away and put the bandaid on. 

the nurse gives me a note to show that i've been to her, on which she writes ""stapled finger"".  

i get back to my class and i glue the staple to the note because why not. then i decide to actually staple my assignment. i look through it to make sure everything is there and what do i find? the second page is blank. i didn't need to staple my assignment at all. 

this whole situation could have been avoided if i had just checked my work first.

so were all happy to be back together all weekend and sunday turns immediately into an aggressive sunday-funday. grad school friend brings myself and another one of my friends around campus while the other part of the crew is re-upping at the liquor store.

its a beautiful campus, there's an amphitheater in a nice open area and, due to alcohol, we start using the amphitheater as a playground and start jumping around and just overall having a good time.

liquid confidence is very high at this point so i jump a gap in the amphitheater. nailed it. liquid confidence lvl: **** see a trashcan near me among the same height as i am. so i go for it.

as i am flipping backwards and sideways, i realize that the trash can isn't bolted to the concrete square in the grassy area its standing on. i also realize its completely empty. i figure, if this goes bad i fall in the grass, say ow, and continue on with the day.

instead, i go straight right instead of any other direction, and meet the concrete sidewalk with the right side of my face, left wrist, and somehow sprained my left ankle.

eventually my body stops vibrating, and after some water i settle down and take the night off. i still feel like i want to **** but at least i'm not passed out. 

it turns out that i should have not only read the coffee packet for the *expiry date* but i should have also checked to see that it was really *instant coffee* (which you only really need use one teaspoon of, i probably had the equivalent of about 7 or 8 cups of coffee in one hit. my normal amount is about twice a month!)

 

edit: it was about the equivalent of around 10-12 cups apparently. the instant coffee was powder that you just put into hot water, it had about 50mg caffeine in less than a teaspoon of powder and the group holds around 10 teaspoons. so i'm guessing that was almost 0.5g or more of caffeine

this morning a couple came in looking to buy a bike and i so i started helping them. they seemed to be pretty well to do since they didn't really bat an eye at the cost of the bikes and were saying the woman looking for a bike should treat herself. this is good and bad because it means they are very likely to buy something but are very likely to be difficult to help. they wanted to try just about every version of the bike they were looking at to make sure it was right (even riding different colors just to be sure). after about an hour of helping them, they decided to buy a medium black and green quick 4 for $750 as well as a new seat and water bottle holder bringing the total to over $800 before tax. i was feeling pretty good about getting that sale done.

then near the end of the day, a man and his son came in saying that they were here to buy the bike they were going to buy yesterday but had to wait for the manager to assemble it. i asked what it was and the father said it was a medium black and green quick 4. i discreetly told the manager who'd stayed after closing yesterday to assemble the bike for him. so then he had to tell the man that we'd sold the bike earlier today because no one had told me about it. the man was very upset and left saying he'd never spend money here again. luckily the manager wasn't upset with me, he was more upset with how the man was so upset. so i still haven't **** up this job but i'll let you guys know if i do.","background: i just started working at a cycling shop full time for the summer so that i can have some extra money. i'm still a new employee and it's my first job so i'm trying to do my best.

i work at a local hardware store, and i get to my usual moring task of cleaning out our paint tinting machine. 
the machine says two colorants are low: a purple one and a blue one.
i go and refill them. i refill the blue one first. then the purple.
as i was finishing, by chance i looked at the can of colorant that i had just filled the purple tank with.
and at that moment i knew.

i **** up.

i had just poured the blue colorant into the purple tank, and vice versa. 
i had gone through a training course for tinting paint, and the number one thing they drilled into my head was:
don't mix up colorants, because if you mix them up, it can no longer tint accurately and the whole machine has to be sent out for cleaning and repair.

i go to the back and immediately unplug the machine and urgently call my manager over on the radio.

...when she got there and i explained what happened, i've never seen her cringe like that before in my life. 
...it may be safe to say she might not be my manager for much longer.

 

edit: update. luckily, i have another co-worker that knows how to flush and clean out the machine in the store. apparently this isn't the first time this happened, so he went ahead and cleaned out the machine for me, and my manager has no hard feelings, because accidents happen.

this starts with me getting a code for the beta from a mac user so a friend can have a game that we can play (long story with that so wont go into details here may do in comments) so after giving the code i try to open the xbox app in hopes of finding my friends xbox id (so we can do multiplayer) fastforward slightly, this is after me trying to force the xbox app to log out and log in again, im in a remote service session with microsoft support, they try everything from refreshing the windows store to reinstalling the xbox app nothing works so then they go to start a windows re-imaging process (basically reinstalling the os) before they get chance to do anything they get disconnected, i wait about 10-20 mins letting my net settle because wi-fi for me can be funny, nothing. i end up having to make sure they cant re-connect because i have to go to a friends to do some minecraft recording (modded minecraft not windows 10 edition).

yesterday i reinstalled windows 10 from the image i made myself a few days prior, thinking that it would be the pro edition i thought nothing of it, did a few things around the house while it was installing and updating got back and realised it was the home edition, at first i thought nothing of it tried to do some modded minecraft and it ran at what felt like negative frames per second. thought something was up and found out that home couldn't give enough ram for what i was needing so i ended up reinstalling windows 7 ultimate to get it to windows 10 pro (via free upgrade thing) but that produced problems because i didnt have a product key that would work (i used to run windows loader to get the keys to work and used it to install windows 7 on friends and families machines) thankfully i found a windows 10 disc that has pro on and ended up using that.

even if i had fever i would never miss exams let alone a test. i tried everything from getting a fake sick leave to coming up with a letter suggesting i wasn't mentally stable to write the papers. unfortunately, none of these worked.","this happened on a saturday morning, a lovely morning it was... .i switched on my computer to start binge watching a whole lot of movies. 2 hours later i decide to open steam to check what's new and who's on. to my surprise i see a message popping up and i quickly open it to see what's all the fuss about. it was my friend and what he had to say made the rest of the day a living hell. he asked me about my exams and their dates.

after 3 rounds of interviews i was still standing.  i had one last meeting to get through - and it was going great until the last question.

""talk about a situation where teamwork and collaboration really made a difference.""

""i'm captain of my soccer team.  and practice this past friday was attended by quite a few girls.   everyone's first instincts are to show off and be as impressive as possible.  but i decided to hold back and give my team mates a chance to shine.""

my interviewer's demeanor visibly changed, and i realized immediately that she wasn't at all keen on my answer.   i shifted gears and provided another example about a group project at school.

it failed to rekindle her interest though.  she said nothing about either of my examples.   she asked no follow up questions at all.  

""do you have any questions for me?"" she asked tersely.  when all was said and done, the interview ended 10 minutes early.

****.","a month or so ago i scored the opportunity of a lifetime by being accepted as a candidate for a 2016 paid summer internship at a large global bank.  i'm an excellent student majoring in business and i'm graduating in june.  so this internship could turn into a full time job come the fall.

after 3 rounds of interviews i was still standing.  i had one last meeting to get through - and it was going great until the last question.

""talk about a situation where teamwork and collaboration really made a difference.""

an hour later i was working on a machine that pulls the air out of packages and seals it. these machines are very expensive and difficult to fix. i was attempting to seal a package and had to press the reset; what i didn’t know was stepping on the peddle to close the machine and hitting the reset button would completely break one of the most important parts of the machine. the machine opened up and the metal prong that sucks the air out of the package was completely bent upward and the laminate package was melted to the top of the machine. according to my supervisor, i had just made a $500 ****. i got to sit in the chair of shame for the rest of my shift because the machine was down and i had nothing to do.","this happened monday.

about 15 years ago i worked in a microbiology lab in the media kitchen area.  basically my job consisted of washing dishes but i also sometimes was put to work making reagents, filling petri dishes, etc.  

on this particular day i was set to task to make a blue dyeing reagent meant to be used in a production run for a stool sample testing kit.  since it was for production and not just lab use it was very important that it be made correctly. this was stressed to me repeatedly. ""this needs to be by the book!""

so instead of just processing off the order sheet i pulled our department reagent book to get the official formulation and created the item from that.  now is where the fu comes into play.  whoever it is that put in the order had at some point changed the formulation and we had an old copy of it in our book.  the book showed the weights listed in mg or milligrams, but the order had it in mcg or micrograms.  so i proceed and process the order by the book!

reagent goes off to production and is ran and made into testing kits.  the next day quality assurances pulls a few kits to test and they fail.  horribly.  why? well there was 1000x more blue dye than the order called for.  

i get pulled into a meeting where i get dressed down about this fu that's costing the company thousands to fix.  i am beside myself with guilt and apologize.  when i notice the discrepancy i bring it up to the person who ordered the reagent, she takes it to my boss's direct supervisor who then dresses down my boss for the fu of not updating the formulation book for 3 years.  i then get treated like a **** for the remaining 6 months i worked there.","obligatory ""this did not happen today.""

with the cord unplugged,  i grabbed the scissors and began trying to cut through the thick cord. i was sitting indian style on my bedroom floor and i remember thinking how hard it was to cut through this **** thing. 

all of a sudden there's a loud electrical pop! and i feel a surge of electricity in my body,  tensing me up. i dropped the scissors and sat there in shock. i'm not sure if there was an electrical short because it was over quick and i was able to drop the scissors. 

i was really so shocked thinking ""i almost just killed myself!"" once i got my wits about me i unplugged everything and untangled the wires. i had never unplugged the printer...i unplugged a cord for an amp that looked identical. i felt really dumb and shameful thinking i could have died **** and in my bedroom home alone. my poor parents would have had to deal with the grief of losing their idiot child.

i crawl into bed, and, knowing myself, i wake up every few hours to readjust. i would set my watch to beep, but i felt that, for sure, i would have woken up. on days like this, my parents call me to make sure i don't sleep through it, anyway. i close my eyes and fall sleep very quickly.

i wake up, and after moving around a bit and unswaddling myself from the blankets, i suddenly notice that it is dark. ""oh fuck, what time is it?"" i fumble with the button on my watch that activates the backlight. i finally press it. 

""6:45""

oh. my. god.

i start freaking out, trying to make it look like i went to school so i won't get in trouble. i throw my backpack in the kitchen, and my shoes next to it. before i can get in the shower, my mom comes home.

""what the fuck, canobiecrazy, are you *trying* to flunk out of school? you know that this was your 7th time.""

i rushed home after work to get ready to meet my so for dinner. i just needed to shower and change clothes but my contacts have been bothering me for 3 or 4 days (left eye has been blurry) so i decided to put new ones in too. 

in a rush i threw my old ones in the trash and got two new ones out. my eyes have different prescriptions, the left has an astigmatism which requires a special lense, so i double checked that i was putting them in the correct eye. 

the right one was perfect and felt great (anyone with disposal contacts knows how great new ones feel). my left eye was still really blurry and bothering me like the old contact. oh well, sometimes the astigmatism lenses take a while to align correctly with your eye and it can be blurry. 

five minutes later it was still bad so i took the new lense out, rinsed it and tried again. still blurry. ****, this is annoying. guess i'll shower quick and see if it aligns. nope. 

**** **** ****. what's wrong with my contact? what's wrong with my eye?! eye problems run in my family (mom almost had a retina detach once), did something just happen to my **** eyeball??! it's been bad the last few days and i haven't had a check up for 1.5 years! 

i get out and take the lense out to inspect it. looks fine. but wait... i can see better with it out. i look closely at my left eye in the mirror. ****! i never actually took the old lense out and i had been wearing two stacked on top of each other. it was pretty relieving but i feel like an idiot.

i'd never been to this donor centre before so i wasn't sure about the parking sitch so i parked a few blocks away and walked, and i'd been at work all day and was really tired, and just lost like a half litre of my blood, and i decided to cut through the mostly-dry storm drain to get back to my car.

i didn't realise how steep the edge was until i was standing over it, but i slid down (in my professional work attire) and walked across to the other side. that's when i really realised how steep it was, and how much of a **** gravity is.

unable to get up the other side, i ponder my situation and start walking the length of the drain hoping the edges will either become less steep, or lower. 

i came across a couple of wet, slimey pipes, but they were too slippery for my to hoist myself up.

i had visions of me having to call my mother (who lives an hour away) or the fire brigade to help me because i'm a lazy ****, but after about twenty minutes of solid anxiety and embarrassment i found a dry pipe and used it to climb out.

this is how i **** up. today we were waiting for a presentation and happened to be in the same room we were in for work orientation. that brought up the topic of first impressions, so i foolishly decided to share mine of her. it was a day after flying 10+ hours across continents, so nobody was in top shape. but i remember seeing her for the first time and thinking i'm glad she's not a 10, or else that could make work awkward, should any physical relationship arise. after knowing her a while, it is clear that initial impression was way off, as she is actually beautiful. being as close as we are, i thought we were close enough to share this story. 

she kinda laughed it off and joked, but idk how she really took it. it's all i've been thinking about since it happened, and don't know what i can do to make it up to her.","so let me preface by saying that i'm a dude, and she is probably my best friend within 3000 miles. we both just moved to a new country as part of a grad program, and got paired up to work for the same company. we've never been anything more than friends, but i don't think i've ever gotten along so well with another girl. not only is she smart, funny, and nice, but also very attractive.

but just a couple seconds after i had my stream flowing, the 8-month old adolescent cat decided he was too lazy to jump up to the sink like he normally does. instead, he thought he would be clever and take two smaller jumps; first, onto the toilet, and then up to the sink. the whole thing happened in under a second, so i didn't have time to react. he had jumped up onto the lip of the toilet and ran across the front of it, interrupting my stream of ****. a stripe of it now ran from the back of his head, down his back, and ended near the base of his tail. he didn't flinch, and proceeded to perch himself on the counter and stare into the empty sink, waiting for me to turn on the water for him; i'm not even sure he realized what had happened. he got a bit more water than he bargained for; i immediately gave him a quick bath. fortunately, he doesn't seem to hold any hard feelings about it.","to be fair, the fuck-up wasn't entirely mine, but, as they say, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. also, this happened 20 minutes ago.

so i told him how to repair it. he didn't understand what i was saying, so i decided to demonstrate what to do. he was copying every steps that i did, so he wouldn't have a problem later on. there was this one step while solving this problem, that i had to open a program called ""diskpart"", and there is a feature named ""clean"" which completely formats the hard disk.  so, i said that you just have to type clean there (and i typed clean too) and press enter (which i was very careful not to press). he started reviewing the steps he had written to make sure everything was fine. when it was all right, i just said ""yeah!! that's it, and at last just press enter."" and i actually pressed enter at that time. i immediately realised that clean command was still typed there and my hard disk was starting to format. i removed the laptop's battery as soon as possible, and waited for sometime before keeping it in again and restarted my pc. unfortunately, all the data had been lost. it was gone beyond recovery. well, i thought it was not a big deal. but when my parents came home, they were surprised to see every documents they had on pc deleted.

they asked what happened and i told them the truth. they didn't do anything to me(fortunately) but i came to know yesterday that the laptop had my mom's only digital copy of her masters degree thesis, and my family suffered a heavy loss of around $5000 work as my father lost some valuable office documents he had prepared for around a month. i am just glad that my parents are not giving me **** right now.","this happened like two week before. my cousin was trying to format his computer and upgrade to windows 8 from xp. but due to hard disk problem, it didn't install anything above windows xp. so, he asked me if there was any thing that was wrong with the computer. he shared me some technical errors that appeared at the screen, which i immediately recognized as hard disk problem.

 that he was standing up for someone). the entire class proceeds to laugh at me for being such a **** and looking up to this guy. did i mention we have a kid doing a paper on putin on heroism??? so i turn red faced and mentally face palm as my teacher ( who is a great guy) turns off the smart board and prints me a massive article on bono. i am so embarrassed i am afraid to ever mention my music tastes again. and the icing on the cake? the band i hate the most ( behind one direction and those types of ""bands"") is u2. ****.","first off, this is my first post on tifu and its on mobile so i'm sorry in advance for spelling errors and grammar

we had a good time. with the chinese new year festive season the movies were so packed but thankfully we got good seats. 

but that's not the point here. 

i don't have a physical memento of today. no photo. 

i don't even have the movie tickets with me. she has them .... 

first, we bought the tickets. then since we still had time before the movie starts i decided to sit down and have a chat with her. we only had like 40 minutes before the movie starts. 

after chatting so long i realized this is my chance to get a photo taken, i took out my phone, asking what phone she's currently using cause she lost her phone to robbers months ago. i thought this was my chance, but then she kept on going about how she got robbed and i can't allow myself to stop the topic as i find it is actually a sensitive matter, plus i wanted to know more too. so i lost my chance. then we had to quickly go back to the cinema and buy popcorn & drinks last minute, and proceeded into the halls.

after the movie, i was thinking: *you know what? i'll just stop in front of her house later, then take a photo together before i drop her off. okay sounds like a perfect plan.* we had to rush because she's going off to her grandma's place for dinner later and we're a little late. 

here comes the **** part. 

we arrived in front of her doorstep.......................  holy **** her family are all outside waiting for her ! **** this. 

i can't take a photo with all her family outside the house waiting, i'll look like a dumb ****. seriously.

for midnight shift workers, they are a total pain. add in a movie as popular as deadpool, and they've become a right nightmare.


it's a saturday, i'm working midnight shift and i get tired of hearing doors opening and kids giggling etc. i decide to do what our rent-a-cop won't do: tell a kid off. partly to ease my boredom, partly to hopefully teach these kids a lesson. 


i walk down the hall where a gangly young teen is loitering by the bathrooms. i ask him what he's doing and he points to the women's bathroom and says, ""waiting on her.""  i assume he's talking about another teenager, so i tell him to get back to his movie. he seems hesitant, but i insist, saying that i'll wait for his friend. (i'm assuming she's also a teenager bent on causing trouble.)


he makes a beeline for deadpool, and when i ask to check his ticket to see if that's his correct movie, he says he doesn't have it. it's at this point that his mother comes out of the bathroom, to find her teenaged son crying, standing in the hall with a stern (and then confused) looking theatre worker. she turns to him, saying, ""what's wrong?"" she then asks me what he did. 


i have to explain to this woman that i assumed her teenaged (obviously emotionally or mentally delayed) son was sneaking into an r rated movie without a ticket. she understands, but by this point this poor kid is properly crying and is scared that he's in trouble and that i'm going to kick his family out of the film. 


i apologized for the misunderstanding, hating myself a little and thinking that maybe the do-nothing rent-a-cop has the right idea after all.","tifu reddit ... i work at a small movie theatre, where every single saturday night a huge group of teenagers will come to ""see a movie."" really, these kids will buy a ticket (any ticket they can get their hands on) and spend the whole evening walking the halls, disrupting other patrons and repeatedly trying to sneak into r rated movies.

my girlfriend is a freak at swimming, so being the great guy that i am, i had decided to purchase tickets to sydney to watch her swim in the nationals competition. accommodation was already provided by her family so that meant all i had to do was bring money to purchase whatever i wanted. she was only competing two days, so this meant that out of the whole week, i had about 4-5 days to relax with her and her family.

now the **fu**...

so to explain myself on how this fu even occurred, i will first off tell you all that we were all sitting on this kind of [couch](http://img2.wfrcdn.com/lf/50/hash/28885/11164289/4/innova-australia-corner-sofa-bed-with-storage-chaise-s2123b.jpg). i was lying down with my head at the end of the extended part, with my gf next to me with her feet near my head and the same with her father... being the kind of person whose hands have to be doing something all the time, they roamed until they found a foot. i started massaging it, in hopes that my girlfriend would appreciate the gesture; only to hear *""you right there mate? you have a foot fetish or something huh?""* immediately i let go, and tried to play cool by stupidly saying ""i was just giving a soldier like you a well deserved foot massage."" oh yeah, forgot to mention, her father is a soldier...",,,,,,,,,,,,,

when i woke up, i couldn't open my right eye because it was swollen shut and my thumb was so swollen it was stuck in a ""thumbs-up"" position. my bottom lip made me it look like i was doing a bad sylvester stallone impression and i was riddled with these red circular raised spots on my chest. skipped class for the day and missed the exams. the swelling magically subsided by the end of the day though. i found out later that i had been feasted upon by cockroaches. apparently they like to nibble on fingernails and eyelashes, especially when coated with chicken oil.

 


edit: wow, i didn't expect this to this to blow up this much!

for those asking, i'm from the philippines. back in my elementary days, i came from this private school that had more freedom in the way they do their testing and they do quarterly exams with the last exam having more weight. i just said final exam for simplicity. i didn't realize that term might have different connotations among you lot. but yeah, our education system **** then. these days, its substantially changed.

fastfood delivery is pretty common in my parts. and no, it wasn't the hot sauce, i had gravy.

we spend the entire wedding flirting and the day after she comes over to the house where i'm staying at with my family. we cuddle, and we're alone in the sitting room on the sofa with me stroking her hair. i convince her to head outside and while we're walking i try and kiss her. she's too shy (mentions moving too fast) and pulls back, but the mood is good, so i'm okay with it -- instead, we walk back holding hands.

then one of my uncles shows up looking furious. he proceeds to ask me what the **** i'm doing with my cousin.

i'm horrified. i get this awful cold feeling inside and look at her. she's obviously dumbstruck as well. my family doesn't have much contact with our overseas family, which is pretty large, so there are a lot of members of my family i've never met (which was part of my why i was at the wedding). i naturally let go of her hand and head straight to my mother (who's sitting with her sisters) to find out the truth.

she explains that yeah, the girl's my cousin, but we're not related by blood -- one of my relatives got married to hers the year before, but it's still frowned upon.

so i'm ok but it's best to leave it alone. she and her sisters found it hilarious, though.","this happened a couple of years back. i went overseas for a wedding and it was pretty huge. loads of people came over, because it turns out my cousin (who's more like a big brother to me) is pretty popular.

my family and i decided a few days ago that we would visit some family a few hours away. today, we arrived and started conversation with them in their living room. my mother was showing everybody a picture on her phone, and i was the last to view it. i decided to keep her phone and text my brother (she complains that he never texts her back, so i wanted to see if he replied if i texted him from her phone). upon opening the app, her texts appeared, showing a preview of the last message sent/received to the most recent people texted. my father was in the first five, and i witnessed a message that made me want to claw me eyes out. from my mother to him, it was:

 i gave up for the week and went on holiday with my family. i can back today, and told myself that i would just reinstall windows cleanly. i'd wipe my drives and start from scratch, just so nothing could go wrong.

as it turns out, when i started the re-installer, my mouse or keyboard wouldn't work, so i had to boot from a usb, which took an hour to find the right size.

finally, i'd found one, installed the installer and set everything up. it was going well, the install went really quickly, and i finally was relieved to have a functioning windows 10.

#turns out i accidentally installed the 32 bit operating system.

bloody. livid.

i realised this when my computer could only use 4gb of the 8gb of ram i had, and i was suspicious when the initial screen resolution was 720p, but i thought it was just how things were - none of my programs were recognised my my computer, even though they were physically there, which i'm guessing(/hoping) is the issue of it.

anyways, here in after 4 hours of uninstalling and backing up and reinstalling all sorts of ****, only to find that i have to do it all again.

it's 3 in be morning, and i'm just utterly defeated...

my day started well, favorite breakfast, lunch at the street corner on my work, and dinner with friends and family. now as i lay in my bed, my phone beeps for an alarm for my birthday with a letter attachment to it. i wrote myself a letter last year of the things i should do, adventures i should take, lessons i need to learn etc. as i go through the letter i can’t help but notice that i almost accomplished all of those things on the letter.  except for my biggest fu.

i told myself to stop dating different girl every month and just focus on one. and i did. i met her, and with her i am me, no holding back, no lies, not pretending, i am just me. last year was an amazing year because i have her. then i fu. i broke up with her because i got cold feet and i thought we were going too fast and we are going serious too soon. 

now that it is my birthday, i never felt alone. yes, i have my family but i have an estranged relationship with all of them. i have my friends who i met through games but i they never understand the real me. i had her, nothing else matter except her but i lost her because my 25 year old me broke up with her one sunny wednesday thinking it is the right thing to do. of course the player in me, ignore all her calls, and texts, and never answer the door to even just talk. 

if i could go back to fall of last year, i would kick myself in the balls, or i would even touch habanero peppers then remove my contacts and **** without even washing my hands to learn my lesson. 

i never felt so alone, so on my birthday, i hope you guys learn from my lesson. it’s ok to be afraid, to get scared, to feel overwhelmed, because of the end of the day, you have that someone and the feeling being loved is the greatest feeling of all.

a brit abroad in new hampshire, i was spending the day with my family on a beautiful, if slightly crowded, lakeside beach. it being a swelteringly hot day, i decided to go for a swim. now i'm quite a strong swimmer and decided to challenge myself to go all the way along the beach without stopping. naturally, i had my head down and was pretty determined, although about 2/3 of the way round, i was starting to get pretty tired, to the point where it was no longer fun. out of the corner of my eye, i'd noticed a few people on the shore giving me funny looks as well, so i figured my technique had gone to **** and i was flapping about like a dying fish.

with all this in mind, when i came up for air to find a few more people standing near me (importantly, i was between them and the shore), i gave up, fancying a rest and a bit of a chat.

""lovely day for it, isn't it!""
""yeah, guess it is...""
""you local?""
""yup...""
""wow, must be amazing to live near a place like this!""
""...""

i was baffled! i'd always thought americans were supposed to be friendly, but two of the three decent looking gentlemen were staring straight past me, while the third glowered at me with an intensity normally reserved for tarantino films. all in all, it put me off my swim completely, so i turned for shore...

...and bumped straight into the pastor, lifting the young lad who was being baptised out of the water. down the three of us went together, in an almighty (pardon the pun) splash of limbs. i cannot underestimate the size of the crowd i had somehow failed to notice watching. although the pastor found it funny, the kid seemed utterly horrified (if you fall over during your baptism, do you go to ****?) and his parents weren't much happier.

i learnt a lot about myself, religion and most importantly the sense of humour in rural new england that day.","so this one actually happened 2 years ago, i only remembered it today as i'm on holiday in the same place.

after that night, everything was perfectly fine until 3 weeks later when this sentence was said ""i will always appreciate you. you are one of the best people i know... i fucking hate you! you are a prick. i hope you die!"" and they ran off. now nothing happened between the two things and i hadn't even had a chance to respond to the first comment.

over the next few days people started learning why she suddenly hated me. when i eventually found out what the story is, i can assure you that it is a very alternative take on what i did that evening. but it does tie in with the ""weird goings on"" i mentioned. now because of the way they have been acting it would appear that they believe this completely so i just tried to ignore everything as much as possible and leave it alone. but after a few too many comments, i said ""i am not going to go into what happened but you can guarantee it didn't happen that way. i don't know why they are saying it, maybe it is because of the alcohol."" i decided not go into the details because i know that that would be better for z. and i am beginning to realise that i can handle this better than they would.

well this got back to z didn't it. now z, along with family and friends is wanting to finish me off for chatting shit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

basically, i went to my friend's house for easter who has polish heritage (i'm british). he wasn't actually there as he has moved to australia, but i'm just as good friends with this guy's cousin so i was invited anyway as we get along like a house on fire. (weird saying, huh?) anyway, met the family and some new friends and had a good time. 

now, it turns out there was a plan to get me initiated as it was my first polish easter. basically at midnight on the sunday night/monday morning, they throw water over everybody. so at midnight, everybody got a mug of water and waited to throw it at me as i was the newbie. we were already standing outside chatting and i had no clue what was going on, i thought they were just getting a drink. at midnight, they all threw it at once. i was soaked. pretty funny though!

anyway, that's not the ****. as i didn't know and i hadn't wet anybody myself, one of the guys who i've met a few times before said i could throw water at him as he was last for this to happen to on a previous year and he wanted me to be involved. so i was given a mug of water and i threw it at him. however, my hand was wet from being soaked and i wasn't holding the mug by the handle. so i ended up throwing the whole **** mug by accident. the shot was perfect. for his face. ****. bruise on his nose. 

he was a bit startled but took it well though. he said it and he was okay, and i apologised profusely but everyone said don't worry, it's a new story to tell people. he might have a headache this morning though... 

in case you were worried about the mug, it didn't break. it fell straight on to concrete and somehow just rolled... crazy physics.

,838,part3,family,documents,taking my school's fitness test,31,8,0.7200000286,31,"greetings! younger reddit browser here to share a story from a day or two ago.

midterms were amongst us, and on this particular day i had my physical education course's exam. the exam was made up of three parts, all under a [pacing program]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5vvroplaw4&feature=youtube_gdata_player): running (linked), push ups, and curl ups. this story revolves around the curl ups.

my friend and i had just returned from doing the push up test, and has decided to get the other ""easy"" test out of the way.  we were part of the last group of people to go up at that time.

after minutes of anticipation, we get set up to start the test.

""we begin in three... two... [beep]""

i lift myself up from the mat, to feel a very distinctive rumble in my nether regions.

*oh, **** no.*

at a very young age, i thought i had the ability to perform ""automatic farts"" (that's a story for another time; i was one of the weird but kind of cool kids), and would always be quite the entertainment source for friends and family members. until a later age, i never realized i was, in fact, performing queefs. from the years of doing this, i gained quite the exquisite muscle ability in these regions. with such power, it sometimes became abit... uncontrollable.

the muscle contractions from performing these curl ups were causing me to ****.

i was, luckily, saved by the blaring speakers placed right next to my testing mat. but i fear a couple were quite audible- considering the look on one of the coaches faces whilst i was leaving the test area.

i do not have this teacher, but who knows if he'll keep this to himself.

i do not plan on performing curl ups again soon.","greetings! younger reddit browser here to share a story from a day or two ago.

i excuse myself from the table and sit on the can. not a second later the brown waterfall begins splashing into the water, accompanied by sounds which i never thought my stimach would be capable of making. this continued for roughly 25 minutes, with short pauses in between the torrential shitstorms. i could hear the sounds of fidgeting and discomfort coming from the other room, and by the end i felt embarrassed but extremely relieved. 
i am currently sitting in the living room and trying to make conversation, after having to clean my watery **** off of the inside of the toilet as the water could only take down at most 1/3 of it.

the problem is, i had eaten two entire buckets of extremely spicey buffalo wild wings, and had to drop a massive care package about an hour into the visit. i saw that the bathroom was very close to the dining room, in which we were all sitting and enjoying some nice apple pie. i planned on holding it until after the meal, but the oncoming storm of chocolate rain refused to be held back. 
i excuse myself from the table and sit on the can. not a second later the brown waterfall begins splashing into the water, accompanied by sounds which i never thought my stimach would be capable of making. this continued for roughly 25 minutes, with short pauses in between the torrential shitstorms. i could hear the sounds of fidgeting and discomfort coming from the other room, and by the end i felt embarrassed but extremely relieved.

so my friend he has an old razer blackwidow classic edition and im like sure 40$ ill take it, now this is a in canada and b they are normally 100$ for a decent mechanical keyboard so to me this was a no brainer.

so i rush home excited about this and everything and then the manual says download razer synapse so i do. says i need an update and that so i download the update its at 0% and i wait a bit and i step out of my room, and get a drink of water.

at that same time one of my family members and by that i mean my dog decides to pull the cord on the surge protector power bar thing now in my room i have my desk and pc and on the other to my left is a surge protector power bar thing, and there are some loose easily pullible wires.

so, i pick up the canister, find a lighter that was in a toolbox, and turn the can upside-down. i then proceeded to light the lighter to the air displacement hole(having closed the pouring hole), holding the can an inch from my face as i do so.

of course, the can then exploded with enough force to shake the neighbor's houses on both sides of the house.

my mother comes quickly into the garage with a look on her face that clearly states that she was expecting a splattered me on the floor.

wanna know how badly it injured me?
it simply singed my fingers. not burnt, singed. how is my face still intact? no idea. how did i not catch steel shrapnel to various parts of my body? you've got me. 

 the garage was on the far side of the neighbor's​ house who was home. he then came out and asked if a gas can exploded. that's right, he even knew exactly what had exploded. 

i was the luckiest person on the planet at that moment.

fast forward to a few hours later, and my family decides to head over to the beach for a swim, to which i begrudgingly oblige, forgetting my 'injury'. as i step into the sea water, all seems fine, until i realise my fatal mistake. at first a tiny papercut on my finger starts to sting, but this is nothing compared to the pain that is about to come. it takes about 2 minutes before the tingling starts. the tingling turns into a stinging and the stinging turns into a severe pain. i bolt out of the water, grab a towel and run back to the hotel. i'm now sitting on a deck chair, with my **** throbbing, wondering how the **** i'm going to explain my sudden disappearance.","this just happened and i'm still recovering.

to everyone else: i'll explain

tonight was the second night of hanukkah (spelling? nobody knows). basically hanukkah is a jewish holiday that's celebrated over 8 nights. you also traditionally eat jam doughnuts. that's irrelevant, but nice to know.
anyway, the important bit is that every night, after sunset, you light one more candle on the hannukiah. a hannukiah is a candle-holder/candelabra that holds 8 candles and 1 elevated candle which does all the work called the shamash. these candles dont' last that long - about an hour - but you light another series each night.
most jewish families have a nice and elaborate hannukiah. this thing is a family heirloom and is used only during the holidays. some families have one per family member, some have one for the family.

my daughter is now 3 years old and so i hit upon the incredibly awesome idea of creating a hannukiah just for her out of duplo and sugru. i'm an awesome dad who spent a good afternoon with his girl doing something creative and not watching peppa pig for the millionth time. i'm ready for my award.

that was last week. 

last night was the first night of hanukkah and it worked like a charm!
we had guests so we only let it burn for a few minutes (yes, we're not orthodox and probably broke some rules - that's not the point)

tonight we lit it again (2 candles) and i put it safely on the top shelf in the living room while i went into the kitchen to talk to my wife...

cue: fire alarm! house full of black smoke! black ceiling and a melting hannukiah dripping with big flames licking up the shelf!

luckily no one was hurt, and i learnt a valuable lesson - watch more tv and stop doing creative things with your child!","to all the jewish redditors: happy hanukkah everybody! i made a custom hannukiah for my daughter and i couldn't be prouder. until...

despite any restitution agreement the two of us come to, i would like to replace the head if at all possible so at the very least he can keep the statue on display. i would hope that between that and any other agreements we come to, he and his family can be at peace. i'm posting this here because i can't find anything on this statue and was wondering if anyone can here help me identify a replacement for the head in this [picture](http://imgur.com/qxztjgf).

first a little background information: two years ago my family and i celebrated christmas in the states (we're from europe). and my dad and i are big fans of disney and have always wanted a glorious tree with bright colors and lights in green, blue, red and yellow, and you can't really get them where i'm from. so of course we had to buy some when we were in the states, and buy some i mean around 200 of them. 

anyways: come yesterday and my brother and i are decorating the tree. we start with the lights (as always), and when we have put them up we realize we need an electrical transformer. no problem, we bought one in the states and i take charge for fixing the right settings. i thought it shouldn't be that difficult and it wasn't. soon enough the tree was brightly shining in 4 different colors. as we continued the decoration of the tree my brother pointed out that the lights were getting a little hot. i thought nothing of it really. until 2 hours later. thats when all the lights one after one died pretty fast and they wouldn't turn on again. turns out in the us you use 110v, but i had plugged it in at 220v burning them all out... so no disney tree this christmas. my mom is happy because she thought the lights were horrible.","this happened yesterday, but the fu is still in place.

,862,part3,family,documents,underestimating the importance of my wedding day.,2,8,0.8000000119,2,"this has built up over the past several days, so at this point i'm well aware of how wrong i was in thinking my family wouldn't be greatly disappointed in not being there for the ""official"" event.

quick background- 
  my girlfriend and i met when i first moved to a new area several years ago (closer to 10 than five).  not long after meeting, i was laid off from my job.  by the time we knew we would get married we felt like we needed to be more financially stable before taking the next step.  
  we have now purchased a home together in a new area, and are getting things moving in the right direction.  last weekend while discussing future plans, marriage came up.  i asked her if she ""had any plans next weekend"", and she said ""no"".  it was at that moment i asked her how she would feel about having her anniversary on 12-13-15.  
surprise factor = 100
romance factor = zero

here is where the tifu happens:
because of the short notice, the two of us looked at it as being a legal procedure.  none of our parents live in our state, and we're not religious.  our plan is to meet a few of my relatives and friends who live nearby, and we would get married in a park.  then, next year we would have a planned ceremony and reception for all of our friends and family.
problem is, we are the only two who looked at it this way.  a number of people feel left out, and my mom was very hurt.  had i realized how important this would have been for everyone else, i wouldn't have waited until the last minute to confirm the date.

 

edit*left the last t off of thought.

edit 2- we would have been happy if all those interested in attending could make it but my procrastination didn't leave much time to make plans for the specific day we wanted to marry.

those who didn't make it still sent love, wished us well, and were fully supportive.  they just would have liked to be there too.","this has built up over the past several days, so at this point i'm well aware of how wrong i was in thinking my family wouldn't be greatly disappointed in not being there for the ""official"" event.

a few years ago i, being the dumb **** **** i had been, was trying to find something to help me relieve myself, but having become bored of watching **** all the time i wanted to find a real chick. so i set out upon the many chat sites of the internet, found a girl on omegle and we immediately kicked it off. we seemed to have the same problem and decided we should move off omegle to skype. as soon as we were connected i started getting undressed and the girl on the cam started to as well and was asking for close ups of my ****. obviously, i obliged and about five minutes later her cam changes to show me handling my junk. 

confused, i ask what's going on and they tell me if i don't pay them a couple hundred bucks this recording was going to all my friends and family(my full name was on my skype), and being broke as i was i started freaking out and trying to convince them of my being penniless but they wouldn't have it and started a countdown. freaking out even more, i summoned all the courage i had and told my dad what had happened, and he tells me to call the police about it. so i call the cops and a couple minutes later one is in our living room taking down what had happened. 

oh yeah, i told the scammer i called the cops after being told to do so by my dad and they promptly stopped the countdown and disappeared, but with a policeman there i had to explain why he had been sent to my house. praise be to this man that he did not laugh at the **** thing i had done. he told me i should call the fbi as the skype account they used had an address on it and apparently this was quite common, but they never found out who it was so i didnt have to go to court to testify or anything.

so my family and me had gone on holiday to germany to visit my uncle's new house which he has just finished renovating. 

one day he was out at work and we were in his house with his girlfriend. suddenly my mum screams and we all go over and there's this big green bug. i kind of walk away once i realise it's not anything major and leave everyone else to it. 

i then see my uncle's girlfriend go into a drawer in the kitchen and bring out a bottle of pepper spray (it's probably good to mention that we live in the uk and pepper spray is illegal there so we hadn't ever seen it before). she then goes upstairs and hands the bottle to my mum. 

i follow and start to think this might not be a great idea. anyway, the bug was on the stairs and we were all at the bottom except for my mum who was closer to the top near the bug. she then points it at the bug and sprays. 

as it turns out, pepper spray is red and all the walls were white. when she sprayed it, it was like paint being sprayed on the wall. it was red and went quite a bit on the wall.

we then all realised we had made a big mistake. as we start talking about what to do we all start to cough violently. pepper spray can also travel through the air. we all run down to the ground floor and think we have escaped the air. for a while, it held true. approximately 30 seconds. we then had to open all the doors and windows and we were coughing and our eyes were starting to stream. 

it eventually cleared out of the air and the stain mostly washed away but not completely. we never told my uncle but it's a good thing his eyesight isn't great so he'll probably never see it.","well it was actually earlier this month and it was maybe a bit more my mum fucking up.

that's when tumpy opened her mouth and everyone sees a thumbtack stuck down the side of her throat. using tweezers, they remove it, and lecture her not to eat sharp or unknown objects. then, she pointed at me. everyone's head turned to face me, glaringly. tumpy shouted ""he didhg told eatttttughhhh"". i shrugged and told them i had no idea what she was indicating and they believed me.

two days ago, my father passed away from heard diseases (don't smoke, kids). all of us were gathered around his deathbed as he slipped away. before he left us, he asked us to write down his final words and wishes. he ended up saying a lot, confessing to kissing one of my mothers friends decades ago at a party, among other things, and even recalling his days from the war fighting in south east asia (things he had never told us about). i had the best handwriting in the family, so i was tasked with writing this all down. i quickly scrambled all pens and papers i could find. i found one pen. looked like an ordinary pen. once he had finished talking, he closed he just lay there and stayed awake for another 10 minutes, before passing away. 


the next day, my mother (grieving) asked to see what i had written (i actually filled out 1 and a half pages with writing). i told her to look for the paper in the kitchen. feeling emphatic, i decided to get it myself. this is when i realized the ****. two pieces of empty paper, next to my trusty disappearing ink pen. my mom's pretty ****, but she's more sad then she is ****. i've been hitting myself since then. probably gonna drink myself to sleep again tonight. hope to stop tomorrow.


 


note: i do remember certain parts of what he said about the war. parts like how he witnessed a kamikaze attack and how he watched his friend die slowly meters away from him but he couldn't save him because he would have exposed his location. 


edit: grammar


**update**: told my brothers. we pretty much managed to reconstruct the whole thing, with some parts even done word for word. hooray for teamwork i guess? i'm still figuring out a way to get the exact copy, but we have all the important bits already. thank you all for the support!","a while back i managed to get my hands on a novelty kgb disappearing ink pen. i completely forgot about it until two days ago. using a throwaway because my brothers use reddit (they still don't know)

so, i just poured gasoline all over the big pile of leaves and branches, but it still wouldn't work as good as you expect, so i kept adding gasoline until i felt the bottle heat up. this was the first time i was working with gasoline by myself, so i didn't know what was happening. i turned the bottle towards me to look in the bottle and see what was happening. a giant fireball came out and burned the left side of face completely. my eye got 2nd degree burns on my retina and i had to wear an eye patch for a month, half of my hair was gone, my eyebrows and eyelashes were gone. my face looked horrible and i couldn't shower for the first week because it hurt to much. to make things worse, i was just changing schools and it started two weeks after that.","this actually happened a couple of years ago, but whatever. so, my family owns a plot of land with a pond on it and a lot of large trees a couple of kilometers from where i live. it's pretty remote, because we live in the city and have no garden there, so we basically just bought one away from the city. we get our wood for the fireplace there because every other year there's at least one tree that falls down because it's rotten or something like that. my dad left me in charge of burning the excess leaves and branches, but everything was wet and i couldn't get the fire going for the life of me, so i got some gasoline from the shed in a bottle.

------------------------------------------------------------
my parents & my sister had come to visit me at my apartment home from another state. we had decided to go to the park because we thought the weather would be good that weekend... until it happened.

we were at the park, me playing basketball with my dad and the rest of our family at the picnic table, until the clouds started forming. we thought nothing of it and continued to go on with our game. then the rain started dropping and it was starting to rain even harder when we got to our car. this is when problems started happening.

i had ridden my bicycle to the park because it couldn't fit into our car and i had my phone with me. my dad had volunteered to ride the bike home in the rain since he was used to it. (it rained in the city he lived in a lot) he headed off, but there was a problem. 

the car was completely refusing to move. we had tried every solution but it wouldn't budge, even if we tried changing gears. we were panicky and tried calling after my dad, but he had already gone off. we tried texting him, but he had left his phone in the car. ****. my mother and sister said that *i* should go run after him in the hellstorm that we were experiencing right now.

i went off and ran after him as fast as i could, slipping quite a couple of times. it had been two whole minutes before my sister came, driving down the road saying that **my dad forgot to fully start the **** ignition.**

now here i am, completely soaked typing this up. i also realized that my phone was in my completely-soaked pocket the whole entire **** time.","**this is my first post to /r/tifu. sorry if i made any errors.**

if you've never been to the catacombs, it's not interesting.. it's super creepy. it's basically just one massive dark dingy tunnel filled with bones and skulls. not someplace you'd want to be alone that's for sure. 

so anyway they bring people into the place in groups of about 20 and as you're going down people sort of split apart and go at their own pace, i was about 10 or 11 at the time so obviously i had run ahead of my family, because they were being slow. this is when my inner **** made it’s debut

i thought it would be a great idea if i hid behind a wall. not only if i hid behind a wall, but if i hid behind a wall and waited for my family to walk by to jump out and scare them, you know.. why not? in the most petrifying place i had ever been, why not jump out and scare them?

like i said earlier, my family walked slow. i didn't think that they would be walking so slow that anyone could have possibly walked past them. so here i am, waiting behind the wall thinking this would be the funniest thing i had ever done. when i saw shadows moving towards me i jumped out and yelled “rah” the loudest my lungs could go. it would’ve been great if it was my family, but no… it was a poor defenceless tourist. i **** you not she screamed the most deafening sound i have heard to this day. i have never seen anyone more terrified. that’s not the worst part though, oh you thought that was it? once that ear-piercing scream was over she fell to the ground, she fainted, i made a random woman faint. i honest to **** thought i had killed her. her boyfriend was just standing there laughing at her until he had realised that she had fainted.

my father is a minister and he was conducting a funeral for a member of our church today. the church members daughter was supposed to sing an acapella version of ""amazing grace"" at the funeral, she's not a great singer but it was her mother's wish that it be sung at her funeral. so anyways, her daughter (being a normal human being), was very overcome with grief and asked my father, the minister if someone else could sing in her place. 

in spite of my apparent emotional retardation, i am very musically inclined, so he asked me from the front of the funeral home to come up and sing amazing grace. i was walking from my obligatory seat in the back of the room and was determined to behave with dignity. however, as i reached the front of the room, i tripped over a rogue wire and face-planted in front of the podium/stage area.

seeing how i was already feeling awkward, tripping and falling only compounded the uncomfortable situation i was in. i attempted to diffuse the situation and make fun of myself (before too many people could get up to help me) by quickly hopping to my feet and loudly singing out ""another one bites the dust! another one bites the dust... and another one gone, and another one gone...."" 

cue a horrified look on my father's face that i couldn't understand at first, until i realized i was belting out queen lyrics immediately next to the open casket of a dead person - and all of her living family members, and multiple friends, and church members, and my father - who foolishly trusted me with the responsibility of singing.","so, i've never been good at emotional situations like weddings or funerals. i pretty much only get through events like this by sitting at the back of a room and just zoning out so i don't think of anything sarcastic or awkward.

i grabbed a spare coconut from a decorative fruit bowl, and begun drilling with a knife and a twisting motion. i lubed up and begun the time old ritual of coconut fornication. 

now, this whole process was quite loud and i was negligent to the fact that my family was still home, but by the time i realized this it was too late. 

whooosh 

the door swung open with such speed that i couldn't react. there was no warning and because of the little **** i am freaked the **** out and ripped it off my manhood faster than a bullet.

""what the fuck"" my mom said while seeing me throw a coconut off my bleeding ****. before i could say anything the shut the door and hasn't said a word to me since. this just happened, wish me luck guys.

i often am called only by my last name, and so frequently i tell people to call me it, or tell them it's my first name (it's fairly unique and as i have associates that use this site i'd rather not share). most people just roll with it, but when, just to save explaination i tell this person it's my first, he questions it abit. ""yep!"" i stupidly say, prompting him to ask my last name. i had not planned on that evidently, and in spite of any common sense i blurt out that my last name is 'jeans' off the top of my head.. yeah, incredibly convincing i know.

the disbelief in his tone was obvious, and we goodbye'd and all, but now i'm left with a perfectly nice guy who either already knows i lied and probably now distrusts my information. or, even optimistically will certainly mention my lovely surname to someone and find out he's been lied to. so i feel awful/foolish.","this happened today, and though it's probably minor i feel so dreadful for it. to preface i'm run ragged on a lack of sleep the past few days due to some family issues, probably a heavy contributor.

i've been in north america (note: brit alert) for around a week and a half on holiday with my family, visiting new york city, toronto and i am currently in dc, which is incredibly hot and humid at the moment, especially for a sorry old englishman like myself. it's been fantastic so far - as a history buff and with a keen eye for politics it's been a goldmine of interesting things. today, however, we decided to take a break from the museums and monuments to go to the washington zoo, which i was very excited for. 

so we're there, having a great time seeing the giant pandas (never seen them before anywhere) and the plethora of other animals. whilst walking around in ~30° (90° for the yanks) heavy heat, naturally i began to precipitate in various areas of my body. as a chubbier fellow it does become a bit of a bother, most notably in the rear area. 

as the wetness between the cheeks increases, so does my appetite to fix the issue. what does one do? ahah! a good old wipe! the perfect solution. so in the amazonian section i take to the restrooms where i intend to perform the procedure. 

i lock the stall door, finally ready to rid myself of this plaguing discomfort. the shorts come down and i triumphantly tear lots of toilet paper and give it a good ol swipe. again, and again, and again - until my crack is as dry as the sahara. i feel like a new man as i return to my family...

suddenly on the walk out of the toilets, a soreness rushes from my bottom. the dreaded word - chaffing. every step i take is like a thousand lashes to the bumcheeks, the discomfort multiplies by 20 from before. never before have i wished so much for a wetness down there. the worst part - we still had more than half of the zoo left to see. so the rest of the day was spent very slowly shifting around in the intense heat, just begging for my **** crack to sweat, but it wouldn't. it was torturous, and now my **** is as raw as the sushi i had for dinner.","folks, i have a tale to teach you what not to do on a hot day.

this is a typical north-eastern chinese farmhouse and in the winter, they add plastic sheeting to the front over a wooden frame to create a sort of sun room. it looks like a green house attached the house. 

anyway, i was clearing away all the ice and snow that had accumulated at the base of the plastic and was so careful not to puncture the plastic sheeting with the shovel. we got it all done in a couple hours and i thought, ""great. got some exercise. helped the in-laws.""

fast-forward a few hours. it's about 11:00-11:30 pm chinese new year's eve. time to set off fireworks. lit the fuse, ran back to the porch to watch. i'm looking up at the explosions in the sky when i feel a burst behind me. and then another. we couldn't understand why we felt these bursts behind us until the mother-in-law and the family cat come running out of the porch enclosure. two of the fireworks decided to shoot straight toward the house instead of up in the sky. after investigating, we find the very spot where i had cleared off the ice and snow just hours before had two fresh holes from the rogue fireworks. 

based on the amount of ice and snow there, we could probably have avoided the holes in the wall if it had still been there.","yesterday i spent the afternoon clearing my in-laws front yard of snow. once the yard was finished, we began working on the front porch.

i work as a waiter so normally i don't have to deal with the sort of thing that i had to deal with today.

today one of our bussers lost it and quit, and the other busser that was working at the same time freaked out and quit as well, so we were at lunch rush with nobody cleaning tables or doing any of the small jobs around the restaurant.

we ran our of root beer. ****. the manager asked me to change to pop, so naturally i think this can't be too hard. we keep the 20l boxes of pop syrup in a shelf above the managers desk. the box says don't open with a knife, but i'm feeling pretty highly of myself and i go for it. 

****. **** **** **** ****. i pierced the bag sending 20l of root beer syrup all over my managers computer, printer, keyboard, and phone. 

i couldn't breathe. i freaked the **** out. i closed the door turned off the light and went straight to the change room to take off my uniform. i left it right there in the bathroom, went straight home and blocked the work number. 

 

**update**: still no call from my manager. no house visitations and such. ex coworkers have reached out to me on facebook asking where i've been and if i did it. i chose not to read not reply to the messages. today was my first day at mcdonalds and i watched a bunch of **** safety videos. ironically they told me not to open the bags of ice cream mix with a knife. i have an ominous feeling that you folks haven't seen the last of me.","i work at a small family restaurant. we have about 20 employees and we are a very busy joint at all times of the day.

was too **** to realize the full damage (that comes the next day). i go back into my room, scream this is all my boyfriends fault and demand for him to take me home now because this, again, is all his fault. i was trashed, gathered my things, boyfriend drops me off. i fall outta the car and spill my purse in front of my house but am too booze brained to even register it. i kept my boyfriends spare id in my purse and i wrote in huge sharpie between his name ""big **** boyfriendslastname"". its a novelty of sorts. forgot it the next day and my dad found it. it's a family joke now.
