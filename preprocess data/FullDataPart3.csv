37_2_1,"my boyfriend dislocated his knee over the weekend while he was out visiting me (we have a long-distance relationship). since his knee is mostly okay and we're not about to let some quality bang-time go to waste, we've been coming up with creative positions for sex so that he doesn't have to move his leg.

one of these positions entails me laying across his chest in a sort of upside down 69. he decided to use the vibrator today. he's getting me close to climax and, since he knows i squirt sometimes, he was getting prepared for a possible onslaught of epic cum-portions. i start to climax and instead of cum, i squirt piss out onto his chest as i orgasm. i run into the bathroom to clean up as he lays on the bed laughing his dick off.

39_2_1,"little bit of background: winter 2013 college semester i started to fall for this girl that i meet through a mutual friend. fast forward to a week after school gets out, she goes home for the summer and i start working third shift, gotta make the money, so she breaks up with me. a week later she starts going out with her friend from back home who she ""wanted to go out before but didn't want to get into a ld relationship, but its cool now because this year he will be going to a local community college that is near the college we go to.""

ok, now back to today, yesterday ex-gf wants to hang out for a bit as we are going to try to just be friends as there wasn't much relationship before we broke up. so i hang out with her and the old feelings resurface in me, time to gtfo and have some whiskey. 

so today i went to football tailgating at the college i go to, hot greek little sister walks up with her friend ""hey bigwag91, this is my friend hotgurl, blah blah blah, she just got out of a two year relationship. she is just looking to hang out. had i not been thinking about last night (or maybe the hangover of today) i would have seen this as a total green light on hotgurl. later hotgurl is talking to me alot giving little hints that i should have noticed but i couldn't muster myself together enough to take these hints and lay some moves on hotgurl.

later on i ended up having to go up to here and apologize for acting like a complete idiot in front of her and we got to talking. ex lovers, friends, interests, etc, etc. the ex lovers part was the worst cause after talking for 45-60 minutes she looks and me and goes ""you will find someone, don't worry"" but gives major hints that i missed my chance. 

 

p.s. ""today"" is actually yesterday

40_2_1,"so i work at a grocery store as a cashier. i'm 18 years old just to give some context. there's this hot girl that started working on the same day i did (1 month ago). to my knowledge she was single, hot, and definitely looked like she was in the early years of college or taking a year off like i am currently. 

we got talking. a lot. some days we would both be on overstock or be next to each other on cash registers, so there was always an opportunity to talk.

today, she came in to get some groceries at my cash register. with her husband and child. i swear to the universe that she looks like she could pass off as an 18-20 year old.

i think the rule is to not have any relationships with your colleagues but i work a damn temporary job right now so i could care less. i'm glad i didn't tell her that i have feelings for her.",1. Not guilty
41_2_1,"well, this actually happened several years ago at the end of my high school years.  a group of my friends met a group of girls at a waterpark one summer and at the end of the day i exchanged screen names (a screen name or sn was something used as your internet name when instant messaging).  we chatted and we even met up at the same water park the next year.  
right after graduating high school we were talking about getting together and a summer festival was going down in her town, so i planned to go up there that weekend like a 2 hour drive away.  she had just broken up with her boyfriend like a week before i go up there too!  i get up there an we're doing all this stuff together, like frolfing and hanging out and watching movies till 3am.  we went jet skiing one day and got into a 'water fight'.  the whole weekend i don't make a move because she just got out of a relationship, i was actually dating someone at the time, but that one was doomed, but still loyal didn't want to 'do' anything. 
by the way she's a solid 9/10.  missed the chance to at least date her for awhile.",1. Not guilty
42_2_1,"some back story:
i have dated my now ex for over 4 years. first real relationship i've ever had and the first girl i've ever really loved. we meet each other at the worst point in my life and she really helped me through some stuff.

now my fu:
i've been feeling really weird about our relationship recently, as we haven't seen each other much over the past few months and she's been rather cold toward me lately. i woke up this morning feeling very off and just really down. i spent the whole being bummed out and depressed, until the whole thought started to feel kinda silly. she was having a barbecue at her house, and not really wanting to create a scene over there, i asked her to call me after everyone left because i just wanted to talk to her. i've been really missing her and haven't seen her a lot due to school and work and family, so i figured that was probably ask it was. i was wrong. 

i called her when she said most everyone had left and told her i felt silly even asking, but i wanted her to be honest. ""do you still even want to be with me anymore?"" as soon as i said it, i realized i was just being paranoid and awaited her downpour of love and reassurance. i, again, was wrong. instead, she responded with silence, a deep, heavy sigh, and said ""i don't know. i was gonna come over tomorrow to talk with you, and i'd rather do this in person. but you and i are just at different places right now, and i think i just need to be by myself right now."" god damn, that came out of nowhere! i've never been hit so hard in my life! that's nowhere near what i was expecting!

after a few more minutes of teary conversation and some very difficult text messages in the following hours, she's coming over to drop off some stuff and answer some questions.",1. Not guilty
43_2_1,"so i broke up with my gf like a month or so ago and have since been doing random hookups.

well drunk me thought it would be fun to text my ex, who until now had a pretty harmless breakup and we were still friends.

so i proceed to drunk text her random chatty shit when out of nowhere i suggest she come over and we can have fun.

she immediately assumes sex and gets all upset, granted i totally kind of wanted some, but now she has like told a few people what kind of person i am

like fuck me right?

46_2_1,"ok guys, this happened tonight and i'm still getting the silent treatment. let me give a little background, my wife is 6 months pregnant and for the first time in our relationship we are on the same shift.

so we enjoy our indian food and have ordered from the same place a whole bunch of times. we usually order the same dish each time because we enjoy it, so as usual i order our food, my wife gets the chicken korma a nice creamy dish and i order a chicken in coconut sauce. now its important to point out her dish is usually pretty pale due to its creamy nature and my dish is usually pretty red because of the spices used.

fast forward to it being delivered before she came home from work, i decided to get everything set up so she can come right through the door and start eating. so the food is ready and she isnt home, so i decide to tuck in and start eating. she walks through the door and im almost done and she looks at my plate and there hers and asks me why i was eating her food? i explained ""sweetheart this is the dish i usually get and eat?"" she was adamant i was eating her food! so much so she went straight to bed. she hasnt spoken to me since haha, i still cant believe it! must be her pregnant brain :d",2.

47_2_1,"when i was born my grandfather bought a brand new 78 chevrolet pickup, it was the only thing new to this statue that i know of in his life. it was his pride and joy, when he passed on, the truck was given to me by my father and aunts as i was so close to him. it was old, beat up, had been wrecked, and i brought it back to running condition, and it has been my ugly truck that everyone made fun of, but they never understood the meaning behind it to me. 

i have always wanted to do a frame off restoration and have it be something that people looked at and thought, ""what a cool truck"". i wanted to see his memory and our relationship last longer. i have spent the past decade trying to figure it out but i am not a super mechanic, nor do i have a shop to do it in, nor the probably 15k or more that it would take. the truck still runs, it needs a lot of work, the body is in much worse shape than it used to be, apparently these things were prone to rusting out. 

somehow life just seems to swallow up some hopes and dreams and this is just one of them for me. don't get me wrong i have an okay life, just depresses me this has never been something i could have achieved. i have went to banks but they do not want to do loans for restorations and the few companies out there that do, want insane interest rates. i will spare all the boring details, i am going to be getting rid of the truck due to it just getting worse and worse with no luck of doing anything to make it better. i am really bummed to see this happen, but i guess it is time, i am grateful for having the time with ""ol'blue"" (trucks nickname) that i have had. so i guessed i fucked up, couldn't plan/appropriate/complete the dream of seeing this memory live on.",1. Not guilty
48_2_1,"so a bit of backstory, i have two friends (both girls). let's say that their names are both kelly. i have known both for over two years and kelly #2 was/is currently in a relationship with my best friend while kelly #1 was effectively my crush.

anyway, i have both their numbers in my phone under the name kelly. both are two separate contacts with the same name, as i stupidly put it in that way and never bothered to change it. hours ago, i get the bravery to tell kelly #1 my feelings. i had known her for long enough and i thought that she might feel the same. so i go to text her and realize that there were two contacts. instead of playing it safe and confirming which was which (i had recently deleted the old texts off my phone, so there was no conversation to look through to see which was which), i instead take a guess.

lo and behold, i made the wrong choice and end up confessing my love to the wrong kelly, my friends girlfriend no less. so i rush to explain my mistake to her, however before i can even think of how i was going to explain it, kelly #2 texts back and starts talking about how she feels the same and wants to leave my best friend for me. honestly, i have no idea what to do at this point and i am afraid of losing basically my entire social life over this one stupid mistake.",3. Very guilty
50_2_1,"last night i drank almost an entire bottle of good bourbon. at some point while i was trying to fill the void in my soul, which possibly exists due to previous relationships i've decimated single handedly or maybe my father dying, or the impending thought that my mother,  the only parent i have left, is a smoker and has been for a long time. she won't always be around. i'm terrified of being 23 and parentless especially because i have two younger brothers who i would have to figure out how to take care of should my mom pass anytime in the near future. so yeah i'm drinking with some buddies and one of them mentions he has a spare ticket to the 10am imax star wars showing. so i agree to go, neglecting to realize just how horrible i'm going to feel tomorrow. 

so i wake up this morning and i'm miserably hungover. it was the kind of hangover where you feel like you have a side stitch, like you just ran a couple miles, but we both know damn well the only thing you're running from is your own past and insecurities. can that cause a side stitch? 

we get to the theater after a quick breakfast and we sit down. this was my first time in imax and it was visually and audibly stunning. then it can became visually and audibly overwhelming. then it became visually and audibly nauseating. then i power spewed pork roll and eggs all over the two rows in front. it really just came out with no warning, like spit up. it's a good movie though.

51_2_1,"as the title says, i fucked up using fb, but there's a little more to it than that.



so, from time to time, i dig through my friends facebook friends list, which leads me to another person, and so on, until i get to a person that i want to.....facebook stalk. just a little....not often at all. 

it is my ex's now husband i look at....just to, i don't know, torture myself, or to see if their life is good or not. (it is, but so is everyone's on fb i guess)


being older i should know better than to do this childish shit, but i get bored sometimes, maybe a little sad, perhaps hungry, possibly a bit drunk, and i start digging.

well, lo and behold  i took a trip down memory lane, through sadville boulevard, and ended up in terrorville, as i discovered that the button next to his name was not blue with the normal words, ""send request"", but it was white with, ""request sent"" next to it.


literally a feeling of shock and horror overcame me. her and i did not have a pleasant ending to our relationship (my fault mostly), and i highly doubt the request was looked upon in a pleasant light. i now feel like a jackass.....a total jackass. i do not remember the last time i looked him up, but either way i'm sure he saw i sent that request. 


i ended up taking the request back, as well as blocking him. i did this for 2 reasons.....a: hopefully it gives the impression that i did not mean to send that, and i am no threat, and b: i don't ever want to see that page on the interwebs ever again.",2. Slightly guilty
52_2_1,"today i was visiting an older friend of mine who gives great advise. we were chatting it up about my relationship. my stomach starts feeling nasty but i figure it probably just nerves. a few minutes later i get the sudden(and urgent) need to poop. i'm very shy about pooping. i know everyone does it, but that doesn't mean they have to know when i do. i put it off for as long as i could. finally, i excuse myself to the restroom. i'm done in like 30 seconds. i flush and wait. one piece didn't go down. do i wait and then flush again and reveal myself? i don't want her to know. what do i do? i opt for reaching into the toilet with some toilet paper and picking it up. but now what do i do with it? i can't just throw it in the trash. so i wrap it in more tp and hide it in the back of the waistband of my pants. i'm leaving soon anyway. i walk back out, sit down, and she continues talking. a few minutes later she goes, ""what is that smell? it smells like shit!"" she blames her dog. i said my goodbyes. chunked that shit asap.",3. Very guilty
105_2_1,"names are changed to respect privacy? i'm still incredibly pissed off about this but its out of my hands for obvious reasons. it all started a couple years ago when my friend holly met louise over a twitter fandom and got talking. this eventually became an internet friendship which i later got involved with in january of this year. we all became really close and in april we decided to make plans to meet louise. 

on the 12th of may i entered into a long distance with louise. we have always had a very strong friendship and this carried over into our relationship. she remains the most amazing person in my life. eventually we make plans for her to come down to my city (she lives in the north of england, 8 hours away from my home in the south west) between today and the 15th. everything looks good, she lives with her mum and it seemed everything was sorted with her. what i didnt realise on the other hand was though louise had told her mum she was going down to the south west they hadnt fully discussed dates which caused a bit of an issue.

so i was on my living room sofa with louise and there was a knock at the door and it was the fucking police, so they come in ask all of us questions including my mum because apparently louise's mum reported her to the local police as a missing person and they found my adress from a letter i had written louise in her room. because her mum didnt know she was going to bristol today she got really pissed off and demanded louise go back to the north. so long story short she's on her way back home now with the police and i am devastated because my perfect weekend is ruined. i have full trust in louise and i know she didnt intentionally run away from home. i just want this to be sorted out.

i don't know what happens now but i'm just gonna shut myself away from everyone.",3. Very guilty
106_2_1,"this happened about two hours ago and i’m hoping this will help me feel less shit about the situation. throwaway because i’m ashamed.

so bit of background i’m 25,  i work for a landscape company and have a great
relationship with my boss, we hang out on weekends and he’s the best employer iv ever had, couldn’t ask for better. 

so today we had a very hot day, 35 degrees (95 for the americans). instead of our usual duty’s i was tasked with fitting a flatbed truck with a water tank that we’ve had in storage for a while. 

the day was going sweet, i spent all day drilling and fitting the frame, cleaning, painting and generally doing a great job. 

half hour before we’re due to finish up for the day everyone had assembled back at the workshop, including the boss, the last thing to do was to lift the big plastic tank onto the truck using our crane truck, which is basically a big truck with all the things you could ever need to do our work along with an expensive palfinger crane (for those who are interested)

anyway while we’re manoeuvring everything into position i have to lower the tank to re adjust a sling, the controls for the crane are at the side of the truck and we’re lifting directly over the front of the cab, so i’m relying a lot on two other guys to make sure everything’s going to plan. 

all of a sudden as i’m lowering it to the ground i here a crunch and see shards of glass falling on the floor. my heart sank, all the days work fell apart in a second. from great day to potentially $150,000 bill which i take full responsibility for as i was on the controls. 

happy hump day, fingers crossed it’s not a right off. sorry for the bad grammar, i’m two cones down and beers my homey tonight. 

peace and love.",3. Very guilty
107_2_1,"on a 20-hour roadtrip car-ride split into two days, my boyfriend's family and i stopped at a moe's. for the next 48 hours, i had awful indigestion, but was way too embarrassed to say anything. the day after my moe's feast, my boyfriend kept saying he smelled methane. we couldn't figure it out. 


when we were finally half an hour from home, i burped and he immediately said he smelled methane. so then i launched into a full-on experiment, but wasn't going to tell him about my silent torture. every time i silently burped, he smelled methane. 


we got to the house, aaaand it smelled like natural gas. someone had left the gas-stovetop on for our entire 12-day vacation. we called the fire dept., stood in the rain for thirty minutes while they aired out the house, and woke up all of our neighbors. 


my boyfriend turned to me, quite shaken up, and had a divine revelation. ""i've smelled methane all day! what if it was like, a weird precursor to this? maybe it was some kind of sign from god or something!""


i did eventually tell him that it was me, burping up my moe's, and that god had not sent him any sneak-peeks of natural gasses. our relationship is still going strong.",3. Very guilty
108_2_1,"so last night/this morning i fucked up big style and almost lost two of my close friends and likely pissed off others. 
how one bad decision leads to another. i've been ill for a while, haven't been sleeping or eating properly either but decide to drink.  want to drink cocktails , thought given recent drinking times i'd be fine and controlled.
nope, i ended up a wasted state.
have been in love with my close friend for years (who i'll just call 'a'),  but i am in a relationship with his best friend (have been for years). this is an open secret however and it is also known that a has feelings for another close friend  of mine ('b'). i also know a used to have feelings for me. of recent, a had been a total dick to me repeatedly so i was already feeling wound up. my frustrations were with him being a shity friend but obviously given the situation it is hard not to and can be justified to jump to the conclusion that his shittiness is due to our past.
so this cocktail of bad decisions is then tested by seeing a give b lots of special treatment and fawning. b has no interest in a and i feel like a is being disrespectful to me by his actions. other close friends bring up with me frequently how a's actions to b are weird and obvious as well as a's actions to me are obvious. should point out that a being so overt is really unusal and he's not had a girlfriend in all the time i've known him or any romantic entanglements besides that i've mentioned.  
so, something in me has snapped and what do i do in my drunken tequila induced state and do not remember? i want to make a hurt how i hurt, so i start slinging really vicious insults about b to a. i said some awful things , words i'd never use otherwise and not even used to describe people i don't actually even like.
a has thrown a drink on me, i attempted to physically retaliate, b has overheard all the horrible shit i have said. 
so i stormed out and got a taxi home and proceeded to cry and get in contact with people at 7am to cry some more because i am sick of feeling anything for a.",3. Very guilty

my best friend is very into cosplay (dressing up like characters for fun and all) and i'm very good friends with her boyfriend as well as his roomate. he and i have been friends since we were 12 (we're now 21). anyway, they both got into a major fight, the biggest fight of their young relationship so far. she felt as if they may break up over it, so she texts me and asked if i could grab a spiked leather collar and leather bracelets, since i was home at the time. so i do and i put them in my car saying that i'll give them back to her. no big deal. well, their fight cools off and we forget about her spiked leather accessories that are tucked neatly away in the center console of my car and go about our busy university lives. and this is where my fuck up begins to build up.
fast forward to this past saturday.
i notice that my check engine light comes on. nothing seems off about my car, so i call my dad the following afternoon and he offers to check it out himself and if he couldn't find anything wrong, we'll take it somewhere to get it looked at. 
in my hurry to get over to my dad's house this morning, i didn't clean out my car as i had originally hoped to do, so i just get over there asap. he couldn't find anything wrong with it up front. so we begin cleaning it out.
lo and behold, the first thing my dad decided to clean out was my center console. and sure enough. bam. there was my friend's accessories. my poor 61 year old father gasps and demands to know if there are any other bdsm toys i'm hiding in my car. of course no amount of explination is enough to get him to believe me. so now my dad believes i'm into some seriously kinky shit.",3.

a few days before i had to leave, we were in bed at night half-watching some bad movie on tv. i was exhausted - we hadn't been sleeping much for the entire week - and i was on the verge of falling asleep. we were happily cuddling, and my fiancee noticed i was falling asleep and started protesting, telling me not to fall asleep that she wanted to cuddle more. i sleepily said, ""i'm not asleep yet, i'm just really tired."" after a little more protesting that i was leaving soon, i made up my mind to stay awake. after all, she was right, i was leaving soon and wanted to make the most of the time we had left. mistake.

as you can guess, we started making out. but i was just dead tired - and when i get past a certain point of tiredness, my body just takes over and i sleep no matter what. i dozed off... in the middle of a makeout session. and woke up a few minutes later to an understandably pissed fiancee.

so it all started when me and a group of friends were all talking about which girls we liked. this one guy, we'll call him chris, said that he liked this girl called sam. no big deal right? well, this group of three girls who had no relationship with sam that overheard us thought it would be cute to tell sam that chris liked her. so they started running off towards the blacktop (we were at the playground) to tell her. chris starts following them to prevent this. now this is where things get frisky.

me being the bro i am, i start sprinting towards the girls to try and prevent chris's exposure. keep in mind that i am insanely fast. i catch up with them and kick out my feet at one of the girls and trip her and she goes flying and eats shit on the grass. ""haha one down two more to go"" i exclaim. at this point i think the whole thing is really funny until the girl i tripped starts bawling her eyes out and it's just then i realize she has mud and grass stains all over her outfit. oh shit. i quickly dip back to the playground to my friends where they're all laughing at me and i try to think of story to save my ass.

well recess ends and in the next class i get called to the principals office. fuck. our principal asks so what happened during recess? ""well, i was really hungry so i ran toward the blacktop to go inside and i accidentally bumped into jess on my way there"". so why did you say one down two more to go? ""well, i was embarrassed so i just said that"". it took half an hour of my principal to emotionally break me down for me to crack. it ended up in me writing a letter apologizing to jess and a letter to the principal explaining why we shouldn't lie and my parents grounded me for a month so i couldn't go out on mischief night, go ghosting and trick or treating.",4.

as it turns out, there were too many coats of paint on the wall and the one i added made an older layer peel off.

so now here i am, peeling the paint off of the wall with my hand, hoping it will stop peeling off somewhere so i can get on with the paint job. nope! 2 hours and a lot of frustration later i ended up peeling off all of the paint i had put on, as well as parts of the underlying layer.

in the end i just gave up. instead of 30 minutes of touching up the paint job i'll end up pulling down all the wallpaper and starting from scratch. it'll probably end up costing hundreds of euros too.

  i was emptying one of our storage trucks and as i turned a corner to get to where the stack of products should be put, the stack i was carrying (outdoor solar powered lights) started to tip, but not fall over.  as i drove further down the aisle, it felt like there was nothing on my forks.  i looked over and saw the stack slowly tipping over, and finally crash into the cooler where all the meat is kept.  (it's a single deck meat case for clarification)  

  the solar lights bent the frame that the dual paned glass is in and shattered all of the glass.  we had to get rid of all the meat in the meat case due to potentially dangerous glass shards (unable to see with the naked eye) hurting the customers.  

  it was approximately $5000 worth of meat that has to get thrown out and another $2000 to fix the meat case.  thankfully i'm not the one who has to shell out the money to fix all of this, but it kind of sucks to know that i'll be walking by a damaged meat case every day knowing it was i who damaged it.",3.

i go and refill them. i refill the blue one first. then the purple.
as i was finishing, by chance i looked at the can of colorant that i had just filled the purple tank with.
and at that moment i knew.

i fucked up.

i had just poured the blue colorant into the purple tank, and vice versa. 
i had gone through a training course for tinting paint, and the number one thing they drilled into my head was:
don't mix up colorants, because if you mix them up, it can no longer tint accurately and the whole machine has to be sent out for cleaning and repair.

i go to the back and immediately unplug the machine and urgently call my manager over on the radio.

...when she got there and i explained what happened, i've never seen her cringe like that before in my life. 
...it may be safe to say she might not be my manager for much longer.

 

edit: update. luckily, i have another co-worker that knows how to flush and clean out the machine in the store. apparently this isn't the first time this happened, so he went ahead and cleaned out the machine for me, and my manager has no hard feelings, because accidents happen. 

so i screwed up, learned from it and kept my job. everything turned out better than expected.",4. Completely guilty
260_2_2,"so this started 2 days ago and only just finished (almost) fixing it.

bit of background i'm a bit of a gamer and got windows 10 free upgrade deal with it seeing as i had minecraft pc already i got the windows 10 beta thing. 

this starts with me getting a code for the beta from a mac user so a friend can have a game that we can play (long story with that so wont go into details here may do in comments) so after giving the code i try to open the xbox app in hopes of finding my friends xbox id (so we can do multiplayer) fastforward slightly, this is after me trying to force the xbox app to log out and log in again, im in a remote service session with microsoft support, they try everything from refreshing the windows store to reinstalling the xbox app nothing works so then they go to start a windows re-imaging process (basically reinstalling the os) before they get chance to do anything they get disconnected, i wait about 10-20 mins letting my net settle because wi-fi for me can be funny, nothing. i end up having to make sure they cant re-connect because i have to go to a friends to do some minecraft recording (modded minecraft not windows 10 edition).

yesterday i reinstalled windows 10 from the image i made myself a few days prior, thinking that it would be the pro edition i thought nothing of it, did a few things around the house while it was installing and updating got back and realised it was the home edition, at first i thought nothing of it tried to do some modded minecraft and it ran at what felt like negative frames per second. thought something was up and found out that home couldn't give enough ram for what i was needing so i ended up reinstalling windows 7 ultimate to get it to windows 10 pro (via free upgrade thing) but that produced problems because i didnt have a product key that would work (i used to run windows loader to get the keys to work and used it to install windows 7 on friends and families machines) thankfully i found a windows 10 disc that has pro on and ended up using that.

so i checked on my university's website to tell him the dates. after a long few scrolls, i ended up on my subject's timings and found that the two subjects share the same date except in the timing department one is after the other. i twist my head gradually to the bottom right corner of the monitor to find the current date & time. turns out it was the same exact date. i try to reason with myself that this was an error in the system or no one puts exams on weekend but i remembered that the last few semesters had exams on a saturday. that's when i started to panic and sob uncontrollably knowing i missed the two exams.

after 3 rounds of interviews i was still standing.  i had one last meeting to get through - and it was going great until the last question.

""talk about a situation where teamwork and collaboration really made a difference.""

i blurted out the most recent situation that came to mind without stopping to consider things more broadly.

""i'm captain of my soccer team.  and practice this past friday was attended by quite a few girls.   everyone's first instincts are to show off and be as impressive as possible.  but i decided to hold back and give my team mates a chance to shine.""

my interviewer's demeanor visibly changed, and i realized immediately that she wasn't at all keen on my answer.   i shifted gears and provided another example about a group project at school.

it failed to rekindle her interest though.  she said nothing about either of my examples.   she asked no follow up questions at all.  

""do you have any questions for me?"" she asked tersely.  when all was said and done, the interview ended 10 minutes early.

about 15 years ago i worked in a microbiology lab in the media kitchen area.  basically my job consisted of washing dishes but i also sometimes was put to work making reagents, filling petri dishes, etc.  

on this particular day i was set to task to make a blue dyeing reagent meant to be used in a production run for a stool sample testing kit.  since it was for production and not just lab use it was very important that it be made correctly. this was stressed to me repeatedly. ""this needs to be by the book!""

so instead of just processing off the order sheet i pulled our department reagent book to get the official formulation and created the item from that.  now is where the fu comes into play.  whoever it is that put in the order had at some point changed the formulation and we had an old copy of it in our book.  the book showed the weights listed in mg or milligrams, but the order had it in mcg or micrograms.  so i proceed and process the order by the book!

reagent goes off to production and is ran and made into testing kits.  the next day quality assurances pulls a few kits to test and they fail.  horribly.  why? well there was 1000x more blue dye than the order called for.  

i get pulled into a meeting where i get dressed down about this fu that's costing the company thousands to fix.  i am beside myself with guilt and apologize.  when i notice the discrepancy i bring it up to the person who ordered the reagent, she takes it to my boss's direct supervisor who then dresses down my boss for the fu of not updating the formulation book for 3 years.  i then get treated like a moron for the remaining 6 months i worked there.",3.

335_2_3,"today, i decided that i was going to fix my computer. i'd upgraded straight from windows 7 about a week ago, without doing a clean install, which turned out to be a mistake - i encountered a crap load of driver issues, slow pc, broken programs and all the rest.

 i gave up for the week and went on holiday with my family. i can back today, and told myself that i would just reinstall windows cleanly. i'd wipe my drives and start from scratch, just so nothing could go wrong.

as it turns out, when i started the re-installer, my mouse or keyboard wouldn't work, so i had to boot from a usb, which took an hour to find the right size.

finally, i'd found one, installed the installer and set everything up. it was going well, the install went really quickly, and i finally was relieved to have a functioning windows 10.

i couldn't get to sleep easily, so i decided to lay awake until my sister woke up to go to work (she has to leave for work at 3am) and take her comfy double bed with a plethora of pillows.

once she finished getting ready for work and left, i immediately got up and into her room. i noticed she left her sheets and pillows in a mess, so i start rearranging them. the first thing i do is move her main pillow from where it lay, and my hands catch an object underneath.

i placed the pillow aside and look in horror as i've just picked up my sister's vibrator. large, pink vibrator.
immediately i drop it, turn the light off, back out of the room, and washed my hands for i don't know how long. there wasn't enough soap in the world.

my day started well, favorite breakfast, lunch at the street corner on my work, and dinner with friends and family. now as i lay in my bed, my phone beeps for an alarm for my birthday with a letter attachment to it. i wrote myself a letter last year of the things i should do, adventures i should take, lessons i need to learn etc. as i go through the letter i can’t help but notice that i almost accomplished all of those things on the letter.  except for my biggest fu.

i told myself to stop dating different girl every month and just focus on one. and i did. i met her, and with her i am me, no holding back, no lies, not pretending, i am just me. last year was an amazing year because i have her. then i fu. i broke up with her because i got cold feet and i thought we were going too fast and we are going serious too soon. 

now that it is my birthday, i never felt alone. yes, i have my family but i have an estranged relationship with all of them. i have my friends who i met through games but i they never understand the real me. i had her, nothing else matter except her but i lost her because my 25 year old me broke up with her one sunny wednesday thinking it is the right thing to do. of course the player in me, ignore all her calls, and texts, and never answer the door to even just talk. 

if i could go back to fall of last year, i would kick myself in the balls, or i would even touch habanero peppers then remove my contacts and wank without even washing my hands to learn my lesson. 

i never felt so alone, so on my birthday, i hope you guys learn from my lesson. it’s ok to be afraid, to get scared, to feel overwhelmed, because of the end of the day, you have that someone and the feeling being loved is the greatest feeling of all.

so, i pick up the canister, find a lighter that was in a toolbox, and turn the can upside-down. i then proceeded to light the lighter to the air displacement hole(having closed the pouring hole), holding the can an inch from my face as i do so.

of course, the can then exploded with enough force to shake the neighbor's houses on both sides of the house.

my mother comes quickly into the garage with a look on her face that clearly states that she was expecting a splattered me on the floor.

wanna know how badly it injured me?
it simply singed my fingers. not burnt, singed. how is my face still intact? no idea. how did i not catch steel shrapnel to various parts of my body? you've got me. 

 the garage was on the far side of the neighbor's​ house who was home. he then came out and asked if a gas can exploded. that's right, he even knew exactly what had exploded.

fast forward to a few hours later, and my family decides to head over to the beach for a swim, to which i begrudgingly oblige, forgetting my 'injury'. as i step into the sea water, all seems fine, until i realise my fatal mistake. at first a tiny papercut on my finger starts to sting, but this is nothing compared to the pain that is about to come. it takes about 2 minutes before the tingling starts. the tingling turns into a stinging and the stinging turns into a severe pain. i bolt out of the water, grab a towel and run back to the hotel. i'm now sitting on a deck chair, with my knob throbbing, wondering how the hell i'm going to explain my sudden disappearance.",3.

406_2_3,"i work for a small clothing company made up of a boss and employees that are major hipsters, so i never would have expected this.

i just moved into a new place and everything is finally sound, except my walls are a bit boring. so i decided to hit up amazon for some posters and such to plaster all over the place. i eventually end up looking at flags. canadian, old school american ones, etc. anything that will look cool and might get me praise from my family members. one thing led to another and my curiosity got the best of me. ""ah, amazon has everything!, but would they actually have an isis flag?!"" well, of course i would not dare buy one or hang one up, that's in really poor taste in my opinion but of course i just haaaad to search for it. 

turns out, they don't carry them! i guess that's a relief, i don't think people should be buying those, so whatever, right? i go on with my day! the next thing i know i see two cop cars pull up and my manager walk outside and talk to them. what could be going on? this is a small office where our manager and employees do minimal work and bullshit over beers most of the time. i surely would have heard something popping off in the office, right?

turns out my boss can see everything that is done on our work computers. he uses one of those programs that teachers in schools use to monitor their students progress and make sure they're not slacking off. he saw me make multiple search queries on isis flags and decided to call the police.

after being escorted out of the building and taken around the corner for a talk with the officers, after much convincing and a sheer stroke of luck, i was allowed to go home. 

i have not yet been back to work and nor do i know if i still have my job, but i do know i'm on a list now.",2. Slightly guilty
407_2_3,"to all the jewish redditors: happy hanukkah everybody! i made a custom hannukiah for my daughter and i couldn't be prouder. until...
to everyone else: i'll explain

tonight was the second night of hanukkah (spelling? nobody knows). basically hanukkah is a jewish holiday that's celebrated over 8 nights. you also traditionally eat jam doughnuts. that's irrelevant, but nice to know.
anyway, the important bit is that every night, after sunset, you light one more candle on the hannukiah. a hannukiah is a candle-holder/candelabra that holds 8 candles and 1 elevated candle which does all the work called the shamash. these candles dont' last that long - about an hour - but you light another series each night.
most jewish families have a nice and elaborate hannukiah. this thing is a family heirloom and is used only during the holidays. some families have one per family member, some have one for the family.

my daughter is now 3 years old and so i hit upon the incredibly awesome idea of creating a hannukiah just for her out of duplo and sugru. i'm an awesome dad who spent a good afternoon with his girl doing something creative and not watching peppa pig for the millionth time. i'm ready for my award.

that was last week. 

last night was the first night of hanukkah and it worked like a charm!
we had guests so we only let it burn for a few minutes (yes, we're not orthodox and probably broke some rules - that's not the point)

tonight we lit it again (2 candles) and i put it safely on the top shelf in the living room while i went into the kitchen to talk to my wife...

cue: fire alarm! house full of black smoke! black ceiling and a melting hannukiah dripping with big flames licking up the shelf!

luckily no one was hurt, and i learnt a valuable lesson - watch more tv and stop doing creative things with your child!",3. Very guilty
409_2_3,"so this happened about an hour or so ago. i am driving home super blown because its a day off and decided to hit up the grocery store real quick like. part of me wanted to wait because grocery shopping blown is never a smart idea but i said no i need to do it. so as you can imagine i got a crap ton of junk food and basically spent 200$. i take it all to my car load it and as i'm about to get in i notice my wallet is missing, i mean it wouldn't be the end of the world except i had just gotten my rent money from the atm and put it in there. i retrace all my steps run around walmart super blown out of my mind asking if they've seen a wallet and nobody had. so i canceled all my cards and left my number with the store so they can call me if it turns up but i doubt it will. its not so much the money that frustrates me it's the fact that i had sentimental items in my wallet. my fiances and i prom picture, little notes and family pics and what not. i wish someone would have just taken the money and turned the wallet in. its really a bummer and i'm super dissapointed in myself for leaving it.",3.

410_2_3,"here's the story, over the weekend i went out with some friends with the plan of crashing on their couch. in the process of said visit, i had many drinks and became intoxicated (all too typical of a night, believe me i recognize now it's a problem). when headed back to my friend's place to tuck in for the night, i walked in the door and to the right of it immediately when you walk in is a statue of george washington with a detachable head. 

having had a few many drinks i had decided that i was going to put this head on it's body and slap the statue around a bit. eventually that escalated to a point in which in my drunken stupor, thinking it would look cool, i proceeded to take the head outside and smash it on the pavement (a giant asshole and douchebag move on my part).

unbeknownst to me at the time however this statue was the property of my friend's roommate, and it turns out it was one of the few items handed down to him from his dad. i am not sure what it would be valued at in the market, but i know this guy values it highly and i ruined it. i now feel like the world's biggest asshole and tool, but want to try to find some way to make it up to the guy (if that is even possible). 

 

despite any restitution agreement the two of us come to, i would like to replace the head if at all possible so at the very least he can keep the statue on display. i would hope that between that and any other agreements we come to, he and his family can be at peace. i'm posting this here because i can't find anything on this statue and was wondering if anyone can here help me identify a replacement for the head in this [picture](http://imgur.com/qxztjgf).

ps: i know i am a terrible human being, but would appreciate any help you all may be able to provide with making things right with this guy.",3. Very guilty
411_2_3,"this happened yesterday, but the fu is still in place.
first a little background information: two years ago my family and i celebrated christmas in the states (we're from europe). and my dad and i are big fans of disney and have always wanted a glorious tree with bright colors and lights in green, blue, red and yellow, and you can't really get them where i'm from. so of course we had to buy some when we were in the states, and buy some i mean around 200 of them. 

anyways: come yesterday and my brother and i are decorating the tree. we start with the lights (as always), and when we have put them up we realize we need an electrical transformer. no problem, we bought one in the states and i take charge for fixing the right settings. i thought it shouldn't be that difficult and it wasn't. soon enough the tree was brightly shining in 4 different colors. as we continued the decoration of the tree my brother pointed out that the lights were getting a little hot. i thought nothing of it really. until 2 hours later. thats when all the lights one after one died pretty fast and they wouldn't turn on again. turns out in the us you use 110v, but i had plugged it in at 220v burning them all out... so no disney tree this christmas. my mom is happy because she thought the lights were horrible.",3.

412_2_3,"this has built up over the past several days, so at this point i'm well aware of how wrong i was in thinking my family wouldn't be greatly disappointed in not being there for the ""official"" event.

quick background- 
  my girlfriend and i met when i first moved to a new area several years ago (closer to 10 than five).  not long after meeting, i was laid off from my job.  by the time we knew we would get married we felt like we needed to be more financially stable before taking the next step.  
  we have now purchased a home together in a new area, and are getting things moving in the right direction.  last weekend while discussing future plans, marriage came up.  i asked her if she ""had any plans next weekend"", and she said ""no"".  it was at that moment i asked her how she would feel about having her anniversary on 12-13-15.  
surprise factor = 100
romance factor = zero

here is where the tifu happens:
because of the short notice, the two of us looked at it as being a legal procedure.  none of our parents live in our state, and we're not religious.  our plan is to meet a few of my relatives and friends who live nearby, and we would get married in a park.  then, next year we would have a planned ceremony and reception for all of our friends and family.
problem is, we are the only two who looked at it this way.  a number of people feel left out, and my mom was very hurt.  had i realized how important this would have been for everyone else, i wouldn't have waited until the last minute to confirm the date.

 

edit*left the last t off of thought.

edit 2- we would have been happy if all those interested in attending could make it but my procrastination didn't leave much time to make plans for the specific day we wanted to marry.

those who didn't make it still sent love, wished us well, and were fully supportive.  they just would have liked to be there too.",2. Slightly guilty
413_2_3,"background story: i'm 22 y.o. male home from school for winter break. a few weeks ago my brother came to visit with my 1 month old nieces. this was the first time they were at my house, and also the first time i was meeting them (my parents had already met them). of course, we took hundreds of pictures on a number of different cameras and phones. my mom wanted a consolidated folder for all of the pictures, so i suggested creating a dropbox shared folder for the pictures. i didn't have my computer at the moment so i used my mom's computer to import all of the pictures, then logged into dropbox through her browser and created a shared folder for the family. 

so, last night i walk upstairs and see my mom on her computer. i say hi to her but she doesn't respond and seems focused on the computer and annoyed/unhappy. i ignore it and go to the kitchen to make some food(10 feet away), when a few minutes later she tells me she thinks i accidentally left my dropbox logged in on her computer. oh shit, all my phone's pictures are automatically synced as soon as they are taken. she went to dropbox.com to log into her account to look at the baby pictures i shared, but i was still logged in. i ask how much she went through and she said not much, she was just looking for the baby pictures (the baby pics were towards te top). she lied...when i take the computer to log out i see she is all the way down to sept. 2011, and dropbox has the pictures in chronological order.

with a grimaced face she says, ""there are some things in there you should delete."" i have some pictures that she would not approve of to say the least. oh yeah, and i was just smoking in the basement 10 minutes earlier of which i happened to snap a nice selfie (would have been the first picture she saw). she also definitely knew i was just munching hard. sweet.",2.

416_2_3,"obligatory ""this didnt happen today""

a few years ago i, being the dumb horny virgin i had been, was trying to find something to help me relieve myself, but having become bored of watching porn all the time i wanted to find a real chick. so i set out upon the many chat sites of the internet, found a girl on omegle and we immediately kicked it off. we seemed to have the same problem and decided we should move off omegle to skype. as soon as we were connected i started getting undressed and the girl on the cam started to as well and was asking for close ups of my dick. obviously, i obliged and about five minutes later her cam changes to show me handling my junk. 

confused, i ask what's going on and they tell me if i don't pay them a couple hundred bucks this recording was going to all my friends and family(my full name was on my skype), and being broke as i was i started freaking out and trying to convince them of my being penniless but they wouldn't have it and started a countdown. freaking out even more, i summoned all the courage i had and told my dad what had happened, and he tells me to call the police about it. so i call the cops and a couple minutes later one is in our living room taking down what had happened. 

oh yeah, i told the scammer i called the cops after being told to do so by my dad and they promptly stopped the countdown and disappeared, but with a policeman there i had to explain why he had been sent to my house. praise be to this man that he did not laugh at the stupid thing i had done. he told me i should call the fbi as the skype account they used had an address on it and apparently this was quite common, but they never found out who it was so i didnt have to go to court to testify or anything.

417_2_3,"well it was actually earlier this month and it was maybe a bit more my mum fucking up. 

so my family and me had gone on holiday to germany to visit my uncle's new house which he has just finished renovating. 

one day he was out at work and we were in his house with his girlfriend. suddenly my mum screams and we all go over and there's this big green bug. i kind of walk away once i realise it's not anything major and leave everyone else to it. 

i then see my uncle's girlfriend go into a drawer in the kitchen and bring out a bottle of pepper spray (it's probably good to mention that we live in the uk and pepper spray is illegal there so we hadn't ever seen it before). she then goes upstairs and hands the bottle to my mum. 

i follow and start to think this might not be a great idea. anyway, the bug was on the stairs and we were all at the bottom except for my mum who was closer to the top near the bug. she then points it at the bug and sprays. 

as it turns out, pepper spray is red and all the walls were white. when she sprayed it, it was like paint being sprayed on the wall. it was red and went quite a bit on the wall.

we then all realised we had made a big mistake. as we start talking about what to do we all start to cough violently. pepper spray can also travel through the air. we all run down to the ground floor and think we have escaped the air. for a while, it held true. approximately 30 seconds. we then had to open all the doors and windows and we were coughing and our eyes were starting to stream. 

it eventually cleared out of the air and the stain mostly washed away but not completely. we never told my uncle but it's a good thing his eyesight isn't great so he'll probably never see it.",1. Not guilty

53_2_1,"this fuck up happened around november to december of 2014, but it started around august of that same year. i had just started my senior year of high school, 17yo male and was feeling pretty good at the time. i had never had a relationship prior to this encounter, and i can't remember how exactly we met each other rather than having heard that a junior girl had taken interest in me. now, this came as quite the surprise, considering the fact that i was a skinny white kid that was not only incredibly introverted, but also a little bit socially awkward with very little self-confidence.

anyway, one day we started talking, one thing led to another, and we were eventually dating. (oh yes, high school dating). so, the relationship seemed to progress as normal (or at least what i assumed to be normal, based on the fact that i never had a prior relationship up to that point in my life). well, one night, we we're over at my house watching a movie and ended up starting to kiss, and then proceeded to cuddle. it was during that point in which i took the time to say ""i love you"", and she seemed fine with it at the time and said it back.

now remember, i'm a socially awkward introvert with no prior dating experience. the only reason i said that was because of the fact that i wanted to show her that i appreciated her taking interest in me and spending time with, being with me, caring about me.

well, in about 1 months time this relationship continued, nothing seemed out of the ordinary, and then the day that finals ended and i was searching for the perfect christmas present on etsy, (which was this really neat handmade bracelet with polymer clay animals), she texted me saying that she needed to stop over and it would only take a minute. then she dumped me, with no explanation other than that she didn't feel comfortable that i told her i loved her, despite that she never communicated this with me. so there i was, christmas approaching, feeling heartbroken, alone, and depressed. i mean, looking back, at least i passed all my exams with flying colors. so i had that going for me, which is nice.",1.

at the time i had recently got a girlfriend, lets call her jess. she's 18 and i'm 20. both of us were virgins, so we started messing around pretty quickly into the relationship. 

at first we used bare skin condoms with no problems at all. my best friend, lets say andy, was stoked i lost my virginity finally that he agreed to surprise me with a box of his favorite condoms. 
""free condoms, can't go wrong there!"" i though with enthusiasm. well it went wrong there

the next day, jess and i decide to try the new ones. we start doing our this, wam bam thank ya mam, sexy time complete. the day after she notices when she goes to the bathroom, it hurts. since she still lives with her parents she tells them about the bathroom issue.

so her mom brings her to the doctor, jess tells her doctor (with her mom in the room) that she had sexual intercourse the day before. turns out the lube on the condoms caused the infection. the worst part is that her parents now know i deflowered their daughter within a month of dating her.

61_2_1,"so this happened 15 minutes ago.. but first a little background, i am emotionally distant. i usually do not think with emotions but rather logically.  continuing. after my girlfriend and i had watched the new episode of westworld while drinking red wine,(do not ever drink red wine with your girlfriend if there is any reason she could get mad at you!!) we started to have a conversation as to why i don't express feelings about her the way others do. now, don't get me wrong, we've been dating for the last 3 years and you would expect by now that she knows what she got herself into. anyway, she is overly emotional and ends up crying at the littlest hint of confrontation, this may be because i hate it and will do whatever to get out of that. anyway, we are talking about the status of the relationship and she starts balling.  telling me that i am not going to be mature enough to marry and have a family and settle down.. well... i said halfway through one of her sob/breathe ""continue without the emotional output.""
i am now sleeping on the couch...  in my house...",4
62_2_1,"so we have these family friends that moved here to texas. they're awesome people...or so we thought. 

they lived with my parents until they got kicked out. like anyone knows, don't live with friends. my parents just thought they were being nice but it completely destroyed their relationship. 

you see, not only did they have typical room mate habits (not helping, messy, etc...) but they also have these two children. 

these kids are dicks. seriously i do understand it's because of the way they were raised but these kids are little satans. i can't help but hate them. they really are the worst kids i've met. 

anyway...
they came over unannounced to my moms today. it was just supposed to be me coming over with my son...so when they walked in, i had fire in my eyes. i saw visions of all my sons new toys being ripped out of his hands and broken like last year. they really have no control over their kids. 

quickly i grabbed all our things and hid them before they had even a chance. i was not about to have my christmas ruined. luckily my son is not even 2 so he was totally fine with having just one toy. 

so...all the kids play. my sister is their age so they fought over toys for a while. lots of crying and my sister trying to explain nicely why she doesn't want to share.

(seriously last year was so bad my sister had her toys broken, colored on and stolen.)

so here's where the fu starts...

the little girl of the two children walks out wearing a crown doing the princess wave at everyone. so i smile and say, ""aw you're so cute! are you miss columbia?"" 

my mom lost her shit laughing so hard and apparently the little girl knew exactly what i meant so she cried and now her parents think i'm an asshole. which i am.",3
63_2_1,"i’ll preface this with a bit of backstory: i’m a guy, i work full time in the city but live at home in the suburbs with my very catholic parents. a couple of years ago my mum suffered a bout of viral encephalitis so her brain isn't really 100% but she’s still my mum. sometimes she makes mistakes but we still let her do the day to day things she used to do, like iron clothes and make dinner. mum stuff.

anyway, this morning i’m drying my hair getting ready for work and mum opens my bedroom door.

“dokkanosaur, do you want this hair brush? i don’t really use it.” i’m still sort of waking up so this caught me off guard. “uh, i guess? i’ll just put it in the bathroom if you don’t want it”, i reply. i thought that was a sweet gesture so i said thanks anyway explained where i’d leave it, just in case mum decided she wanted it back. 

“i’ll just put it here in this drawer, okay?” i suggest. “you can put it anywhere you want to, son.” i’m not really sure what she means by that. “sure, okay. love you mum.” i attempt to hug my mother but she resists a bit.

“is everything okay? don’t you want to hug your son?” i usually play this game with her, she’s a bit of a sulk so i like to brighten things up with a hug every now and then. she turns to me... “i’m just a bit concerned about you, that’s all”. not the response i expected...

“why? what’s wrong?”... 
she responds with “i don’t really have the words now.”

ouch. okay now i’m really confused. i’m running late for work so i can’t really press this issue any further. skip ahead 15 minutes and i’m on the bus when i get a text from my brother:

“hahahahaha mum thinks your gay”

oh shit, that’s awkward. what now, reddit?

nb: i am straight and very comfortable with my sexuality. i’ve spent most of my adult life in a relationship with one girl or another (23/m/aus, recently single, feel free to hit me up, ladies). if i was gay, i’d have no shame in it and would have plenty of support from friends and family.",1.

64_2_1,"more like last friday though.

i've only been driving for a year and a half. ever since i got my license, i've been the taxi for my brother.

so last friday, i had to take him to work. as usual, i had about 5 minutes to get him there due to him dragging his feet getting ready. everything goes smoothly until i get to the turn for the street where his work is. it was a green light but no green arrow. there's a car in front of me, pulled up and waiting to turn, so i pull up behind them. the oncoming traffic stops to let people turn. guy in front of me turns, so i stupidly follow behind and just as i'm nearly around the corner, dude comes up the left hand oncoming lane and thumps me in the left headlight.

yay first accident. now i'm on the hook for maybe over $1000 (find out tomorrow how much the other guy is quoted for fixing his panels. i'm hoping that because he came away with mostly scratches on the front and a couple of slightly popped panels that he put back in place before he left, it'll be cheap.)

oh, and my parents have gone back to being really unimpressed with me. any small amount of good vibes i might have earned over the last few months is now gone. that'll really improve our not so great relationship.",2
68_2_1,"this all transpired over a period of eight years...the first time i met him i thought he was gay.  time goes on, i come to believe he is not gay, just not super masculine.  we begin dating.  everything is great at the start of our relationship....normal amount of nookie, plenty of romance, vacations, yadda, yadda, yadda...we get married.  seemingly normal marriage the first few years.  99% of the time he'd get the job done in the sack, just as time when on, the frequency became almost non-existent.  then my nudity never turned his eyes anymore.   i'd ask for variety; not a single thing would change.  finally, i tell him one day that i'm not happy with how things are.  he literally says, ""i'll go pack my shit"" and he moved out that night.  i was stunned, but not devastated.  time moves on.  he walks away from everything except his tools.  the overly-amicable divorce becomes final.  throughout the separation period, my gaydar starts blipping.  he got visibly excited about a mani/pedi (his words and sitting outside divorce court, no less).  he literally got excited about another man's shoes.  his attire....changed.  his hair....got better.  finally,  a couple nights ago on facebook he ""likes"" out magazine, lgbtq advocates, dna australia, hot men blah blah blah.  in that moment i knew he was gay.  here is the kicker...we have a child.  the next day i just ask him.  i tell him i respect his privacy, but because we have a child i feel entitled to ask him, ""are you gay?""  he starts laughing and says, ""yes, i am a gay man."" oooookay....good thing is i'm a vocal straight ally so i tell him i support him and i'm glad he is living as who he really is.  i know there was nothing i could have done to make that marriage work.  i've happily moved on and have a very straight, very sexy boyfriend who i love immensely.  a few nights ago, my ex-husband tells me if i haven't seen magic mike xxl, i should.

70_2_1,"so i will be honest, this happened a few years ago while i was in my english class in college. my professor was a nice enough person, but she was highly liberal with her thoughts. she often tried to get the class discussing/argue different events based on her opinions. my personal favorite was the time she brought up rihanna straddling a pink cannon was a way of empowering women. i had a field day with that one.

anyway so she ends up assigning us an extra paper that was not on the syllabus. i am annoyed because i already have a ton of work for my computer classes, next thing i need is a 7 page persuasive paper to write. so i am annoyed and decide to write on something most people disagree with. polygamy. yes polygamy, not to be confused with polyandry or polyamorous relationships. i wanted to only discuss the single side that men should be able to marry as many women as they choose.

so i already know i am gonna annoy her with my paper. i researched and did a lot of work on it. i needed a quote though. so i decided to look for the most outlandish person i could think of...hitler. by gods i found it! i found a quote from hitler saying approves german soldiers to take as many women as they like.

so i am trolling hard with this paper, i know i am gonna annoy some people just from how one sided this paper is. well i get into class that day. only to find out instead of her doing all the work...the paper will be peer review. my paper got a lot of hate...but i still got a b+. it wasn't until 3 days later i remembered she was jewish too.",4
73_2_1,"welp. this did happen literally an hour ago. 

had a talk with a girl who'd i'd been seeing for the last couple of weeks, we met on tinder but hadn't had sex but have had lots of make outs. hadn't spoken about liking each other yet, just assumed because of the time we spent together. basically went out to dinner with her on the sunday, just talking, laughing, all that good stuff. i invited her round to watch tv or a movie after everything, before we got the bill, she got a text. from then on she wasn't off the phone. not telling me what was going on but she looked upset. 

got to mine and she was stuck on her phone yet again, sat far away from me when usually she'd be sat right next to me, snuggled up. asked her again what was wrong but no answer. then she left to head back to hers.

skip forward to tonight, rang her after a few days to sort my head out as to why things were to weird that night. i told her that i enjoyed being with her but it was unfair to treat me like that, being ignored and given the cold shoulder, even after trying to help. i did say that i really did like her afterwards and she said is that all? the call ended shortly after. 

got a text later 5 min later saying that i'm a nice guy, enjoyed company but doesn't want to take it further because it'd be unfair to me... not ready for a relationship in the end.",1. Not guilty

this morning in the shower i take a look down at mr. happy and he is not doing so well. i can only assume the face wash had some kind of anti-acne stuff in it because my dick kinda looks like a turkey gizzard. it is all flakey and dried out and the skin is papery like an old person's arm. hope my junk doesn't fall off.",3
81_2_1,"well i fucked up today reddit. this happened about 2 hours ago. my ( now ex) girlfriend and i have been dating for about 3 month's now and were very close friends for over 3 years beforehand. over this last month, we have been talking less and less  and today she sent me ""i am fucking up your life"" without any context. well shit, this can't be good. i proceed to text her back asking how could she possibly be fucking my life up. a back and forth argument ensues about how toxic she is and how much of an idiot i am for supporting her and being with her for the entire time that i have known her. i think, okay, i can salvage this situation, we have a long history. how bad can this turn out? i ended up, not only ruining the already dying relationship, but completely killing our friendship. 3 years down the drain.

83_2_1,"this was a few months ago now but can't resist sharing this now i've found somewhere suitable.

at the time, i was in the final year of my undergrad maths degree and i had my girlfriend round to have a night off from studying and watch a film. we started to get a bit frisky then i realised i didn't have any condoms in my room, so i went to go and get one from one of my flatmates. on the way back, i spotted i'd left one of my maths books open on the coffee table in the living room. i suddenly had a brainwave about one of the problems on the page it was left open on, so couldn't help but get to work, temporarily forgetting about my horny girlfriend sitting naked in my room.

about 30 minutes later, i started to hear screaming and crying from my room, so i rushed back. my girlfriend was very angry and accused me of always choosing maths over her and gave me an ultimatum of either i start paying more attention to her or she leaves me. i told her that i can't help being enthusiastic about my subject and she will have to deal with it - she then put her clothes on, walked out and slammed the door. i decided to sleep on it before deciding what to do, but when i tried to contact her via facebook in the morning i discovered her relationship status was ""single"" and that she had de-friended me.",3.

84_2_1,"well this tifu just happened literally 15 min ago. im typing it here because i think this tifu ultimately ended my relationship with my girlfriend and her family. dont worry there are no vulgar or nsfw material here. this is just about my ole dumb self being dumb as hell.

so basically, me and my girlfriend have been going out for 2 years now, and we've had a pretty rocky relationship until now but i love her and she loves me, but by now it should probably be ""loved"". so anyway, my girlfriend wanted to play some hearthstone together, for anyone who isnt familiar with hs, its a card game made by blizzard. so we planned to play it over a new app called discord instead of skype. discord is basically an application where you can communicate over the internet through text and mic just like skype but with better features and not as laggy as skype. on discord you are able to change the name of the different rooms you create. so being myself and wanting to have a nice laugh with my girlfriend, i made the room names suggestive towards my girlfriend's lady parts. this where my fuck up happens. so i made the room and everything, all i had to do now is message my girlfriend on hearthstone the link to my brand new room on discord called ""girlfriends ____hole"". i think you can figure out what the blank line could represent. so i messaged her saying that i made the room, sent her the link and told her to join ""girlfriends ____hole"", but this is where my stupidity hits. instead of messaging her, i accidentally messaged her brother. boom it hits me too late and i go full on panic mode. i messaged my girlfriend about this problem, (just to let you know her brother is pretty overprotective over her and doesn't like it when people objectify her) and she responded to me telling me she would talk to him etc. so she comes back to me and we had a pretty heated argument. ended on bad terms with her and possibly could have ended the relationship and making her brother think im a sex offender. sigh.

89_2_1,"this happened about 9 years ago, when i was in year 8. our science teacher went on long service leave and left us in the care of an old substitute teacher who seemed like a pushover. ms k was an elderly asian lady who spoke funny english and couldn't control the class effectively. over the course of the term, we tried to piss her off as much as we could and she would only get angry and lose more control over us. she threatened us with detention, but we never showed up. the head teacher came in a few times to admonish our class, but we didn't relent in our pursuit to piss her off.
one day, i discovered that the gas taps shared the same connector as the water taps, so i plugged in a bunsen burner and started a whole class water fight. poor ms k tried to stop it but couldn't, until she lost her shit and stormed out of the classroom. i went home that afternoon and gleefully described the chaos in the classroom to my mother, who then went quiet and asked in a threatening voice ""you mean linda k? you dared to muck up in front of her?""

i had no idea who this old fart was, and what my mother's relationship was with her. i only found out when she dragged me over to her house to apologise. turns out she was a close family friend and was there at the hospital when i was born. she guilted me by showing me my baby photos. needless to say i pulled my socks up and didn't cause any more trouble in the few remaining weeks of the school year.",4.

91_2_1,"this happened 3 days ago.
a little background story: i met this girl online and dated her for 2-3 weeks before breaking up. never met her, still haven’t and don’t plan on doing so and all my friends know about this. 

 i was having spanish class and she being the cool teacher she is, she decides to stop class 20-30 minutes earlier and asks about our lives. she goes around the class and asks us questions. 

my turn, great. ""mr. /u/barra420, do you have a girlfriend?"" i answer, ""i used to"" she then asks what happened. (i met this girl online and started dating her without ever meeting her, yeah i know, what the fuck) i proceed to tell her the story of how i met her and she goes batshit crazy. “so you mean you dated this girl that for all you know could be a man? how do you know she wasn’t a pedo or something like that? should i talk to the school counselor?” all those types of questions.

i start explaining myself, every single guy in the class by now is laughing their brains off. the girls look at me like i just shit on the bible and waved a confederate flag in front of a black priest. 
after my explanation she decides to change topic and asks what i do on my free time. i answered that i really enjoyed watching movies and spending time on the computer. she then says “i see, so you enjoy watching porn” every single person in the classroom bursts in laughter. 
guess you can say i have a long year forward with her bringing my online girlfriend up all the time.

 

edit: didn't date her, i talked to her, nothing serious, never told her i loved her or anything. i just say we dated because there isn't a word to describe our relationship.",1
92_2_1,"short fuck-up, not a huge one. it should be noted that i just got out of a 5-year relationship about a month or two ago, so i'm just starting to get back into the whole dating thing. plus, i'm really shit at talking to strangers. social anxiety and whatnot. 

i went to taco bell on my lunch break, ended up going through the drive thru a second time to pick up my co-worker's order. the girl at the window was really cute, and she seemed to be flirting a bit. in hindsight, i'm just really dumb.

anyway, i get back to work, start wondering if i should have suggested grabbing lunch after she gets off work. end up asking a good friend if i should call up there and ask her. he leads with ""that's ballsy as fuck."" but makes the excellent point that i'll never know unless i try. 

being thoroughly convinced, i make the call. ask to talk to her. she gets on the phone, i say something like:

> me: hey! this is going to sound super dumb and i'm not sure you'll remember me, but i pulled through twice about an hour ago?  
> her: yeah, i remember you, what's up?  
> me: i was just wondering, would it be a huge assumption on my part to ask if you wanted to grab lunch after work today?  
> her: that would probably be bad, since i have a kid and i'm in a relationship, but if you want to hang out up here and talk or something that's cool.  
> me: oh, ok, i gotcha. well, i just thought i'd ask.  
> her: yep. well, have a nice day!  
> me: you too!  

cue me feeling lame and depressed. she was super polite and didn't sound creeped out or anything, but i could almost hear the pity in her voice. of course the next thing i do is come back to work and get on reddit to tell internet strangers about it. also, pretty sure i can't go to that taco bell anymore.",1.

a couple months ago, i got drunk and thought downloading tinder would be fun (i was absolutely right, but that's not the point). i started talking to and hanging out with this guy to the point where we were talking every day and hanging out every weekend for a month or so. for the first time since my ex, i started to let myself actually like someone...and then i got ghosted. womp. 

it seems stupid, but i took the whole thing pretty tough and have been trying to find things to keep myself busy for the last month. i came into work today after taking a long weekend and realized that i hadn't finished up this proposal for a huge potential client. i had to tell my boss about everything and i stupidly mentioned the guy, which ended in her giving me a 45 minute pep talk about how i'm worth it and deserve better blah blah blah while my other boss sat awkwardly across the desk silently wishing someone would put a bullet in his brain. i eventually started feeling so bummed and embarrassed that i felt physically ill. then i puked all over my boss's office.",1

anyway, i'd been hanging out with a guy i thought was just a friend (i'd met his out-of-town gf a few times, and really liked her) at a mixer and got too drunk to get back to my place. i wasn't so drunk i couldn't remember, just too drunk to walk across campus alone at 3am.i ended up staying in his dorm that night-on the couch- no shenanigans happening whatsoever.  wake up the next morning, head back to my dorm like it's no big deal.

flash forward a year or so, i'm dating a great guy who happens to be in the same frat as the guy above. let's call him couch-guy. things are going great, we're seriously contemplating marriage. he knows the group of guys i hung out with and asks if anything has ever happened between any of them and me. i say 'no' because i don't count crashing on a guy's couch as a happening. bf then asks couch-guy the same thing, couch-guy says we made the secks. cue ""i can never trust you again"" breakdown from bf... and a lot of coaxing a reassurance from me that couch-guy is an asshole and a liar. i seriously contemplated telling couch-guy's gf all the girls i knew about that he did fuck, but decided to be the bigger person there... not sure if that was a good idea or not, but they're married now.

99_2_1,"...needless to say, this particular device was gifted over to me over a year ago by a then-colleague. since we shared similar interests in novels, they left it set up under their account. 

today, i picked it up again and decided to purchase a book on unconventional relationships (which turned out to be a really good read!) as well as an adult novel. later on, i decided to lay down for a nap and woke up to a series of texts/calls from the previous owner.

it turns out that the previous owner and so share an account, so they (so) found the book charges and confronted the previous owner about it. everything had been left in tact, including the credit card information (which i had switched over to my information prior to purchase) but otherwise, i hadn't modified the account nor did i think to create my own.

as an idiot would, i did go through the whole pc and found tons of photos of her and her ex posing, kissing and many other such photos. i felt terrible seeing those because firstly, i was a virgin before i met her and she was in a long ass relationship with her ex. coupled with my self esteem issues, this dude actually looked much better than me and makes me wonder if i can ever match up to his standard. 

coming to the incident, i was mad at her for some useless reason which i don't even remember now and i ended up sending her this pic saying, "" here. i hope you feel happy about me seeing this"". the second i sent it i realized my fuck up and i feel horrible about it. 

rationalization: how does one react to finding such pictures. i personally feel like shit every time i picture it. am i just a piece of shit person for feeling like this?

that's when she started slapping me... the ferocity of the sudden onslaught bewildered me at first, dashing any hope of me remembering even the smallest details of the fine dream honey i was probably about to get down with.  at first i tried to say that she can't be getting mad, she doesn't know what i was dreaming about, maybe i was dreaming about her and my dream self had just forgotten about our present relationship because i was dreaming from the perspective of my childhood self. she didn't believe it. 

eventually after i got done laughing stupid hard for a good 10 minutes or so i was just like... well shit, no way to cover this one up... ya i was probably totally just about to dream cheat on you babe, whoops sorry. she was pretty pissed..i think me laughing so hard at it made it better for the first few minutes (she started to laugh for a minute too)... then worse for the last few cuz she's still pretty salty.",2
104_2_1,"this happened a few weeks ago, and i just remembered to post it. 

so, i'm in my high schools jazz band and every year we preform at an arts festival at a town near us. in our band, we have one couple who are pretty open about their relationship. 
after out performance, we were all hanging out outside eating street vendor food and talking or whatever, while the couple is eating each others faces out. our band director is no where to be seen, so me and two of my friends decide to screw with the couple. 
this is where we fucked up. to get the couple to stop eating their faces out, we got some pennies and threw them at them, lightly. we had no intentions to hurt them. 
supposedly, the girl in the couple thought we were calling her a prostitute by throwing pennies at her, so the next day we get called into our assistant principals office. we get a lecture on how not to be sexual predators, and how if this happened in a workplace we'd all be fired and labeled as predators. we all also got a detention.",3

i have an assignment that was due 9 days ago, but i'm useless so i just handed it in last night.


i'd been awake and working on it for 19 hours. all that was left to do was make a video of what i'd created with commentary on theme etc.


it's about 4am, and i'm recording said commentary, i must've re-done it about 30 times at this point, and stress levels were at an all time high. 


i would note that a lot of people had their last exam yesterday, and as such decided to go out and celebrate... students will be students, right?


i could hear my flat-mates being rowdy, and in my sleep deprived state, i lost my temper and shouted obscenities at them. they shut up... eventually.


ahhhh, the home stretch. i did one more take and nailed it. brilliant. let's get this bad boy submitted so i can get some well-earned sleep!


i woke up today, and decided to relive the hell that's kept me from sleep for so long. within 10 seconds i knew that i'd fucked up, because the wording was different to the commentary i wanted to use... 4 minutes in it hit me like a ton of bricks... 


*""i decided to use a darker theme to make this floo- will you lot shut the fuck up, jesus christ!""*

212_2_2,"today was my drivers test. i've had a permit for five years, taken two drivers ed courses, and tried to schedule this dang test seven times. every single time, i was turned away because something was wrong with my paperwork: a word or date scratched out, name typed in wrong, or just missing the paper outright.

finally, after two months since it was scheduled, my test was today. the test wasn't until four, so i spent the whole day checking and rechecking that everything was perfect. i went over everything twice with my mom, just to be certain. at three o'clock, she and i hopped into my sister's car - mine has a wonky speedometer - and drove to the dmv.

we spent an hour and half waiting for the instructor. in that time, my paperwork was processed and approved. everyone was so kind and trying to help me relax. i was finally called for the vehicle inspection, so out we went.

she asked for the car's insurance card. i got it out and handed it to her, all while exchanging small talk. suddenly she frowns and says it's expired. by a week. shit. i searched for a newer one but the five that were in the car were from two years ago.

we were given five minutes (they close at five and the test would take 20 minutes) to email her the correct card. mom couldn't remember her password for the company's website and no other family member would pick up their phones.

i was told the next opening wasn't until june 27th. i went out to the car to cry, and apparently another employee recognized me and explained to the instructor how many times i've been trying for this. she made an opening for me early on tuesday morning.

219_2_2,"before i went to work last week, i found something at my door on the way out to rage upon the dreaded miserable day ahead known as monday. upon opening said door, i found a beautiful pink and tinsel christmas wreath with five colored ornaments attached directly on the ground in front of it. one actually fell off and required re-hooking after my door had knocked it over.

i looked around and did not see any other christmas wreaths, but seeing as i just moved in, i figured my lovely apartment building must have given me a holiday gift. note: they also gave me a goody bag upon move-in in october, and the security staff all love me. clearly i'm worthy of a free christmas wreath!

fast forward to a week later--a sunday. i heard a lot of knocking and chatter on doors throughout the evening with much confusion and wondered what was up. then i heard talking outside my door. ""maybe we should just leave a note and ask.""

knock knock knock

i answer. a neighbor and her boyfriend were there. i had met several times prior (they actually gave me a free sam adams mug once, i believe. they won it at an event and the bf didn't want to bring it back to baltimore.

the woman asked if i had seen any christmas wreaths around. i told her what happened. then she replied.

""so ya'll don't have it then?""

""no, i'm saying i do have it. you want it back?""

""oh. yes, please!""

""awww. well, you've ruined christmas for everyone!""

i went and got her the wreath, handed it over, and she and the boyfriend looked pleased, if not bemused. i feel they actually believed me, but today i fucked up...by stealing christmas decorations from neighbors.

220_2_2,"so this actually happened this morning before work. i've been staying at my parent's house since my dad has been sick. we've been trying to keep an eye on him. in the guest room there is my old bunk bed and a futon; for a while, id been sleeping on the futon because i'm 26 and felt like i was too old to use a bunk bed. that lasted about two weeks, or until last night, when i decided that i'm old enough to not care if i'm childish sometimes lol. so i slept on the bunk bed, and of course, it had to be the top bunk. my parents live in a small place so the bed nearly reaches the ceiling anyway. slept like a baby. my alarm scared the shit out of me when it went off and i jumped up like usual, hitting my head full force on the damn ceiling. like a five-year-old who just had their toy taken from them, i screamed for my mom immediately. i hear her running up the steps and i'm still a little fuzzy; she tries to open the door but my shit is all over the place and its not budging. starting to realize i'm fine and not five, i shout that i'm fine but its too late. she pushes the door open with all her might and it gets stuck on some clothes; she trips and hits her head on the steel bars of the bed and now i feel like shit because of it. she's holding back tears and rubbing her head while asking if i'm okay, i tell her i'm fine and am apologizing like crazy. then my dumbass tries to get off the bed and misses the bar causing me to do a split...i'm not flexible at all. so now i'm shouting obscenities and i cant tell if she's laughing or crying. eventually, i got down and everyone was fine. the day was decidedly spent (by my mom) sitting in the living room and talking about how i've always been clumsy and she finds it hilarious. i really can't wait to just go back home to my apartment and pretend this never happened.",2
221_2_2,"as is the usual on a friday, i leave work and go home for some ""lunch""(we refer to it as fuck me fridays at home).  things we're going well, i walked in the door and said hello to the dogs, then walked over to say hi to my wife.  we walked into the kitchen to set down the food i brought home(i love you jimmy johns!), and well... things escalated quickly. 

we didn't even make it all the way into the kitchen before clothes started coming off.  she had taken my shirt off and pulled my pants down, i didn't even bother taking my shoes off because this was happening then and there--no time for disrobing completely.  at first she was sitting up on the counter bracing herself with her feet against the fridge while i did my best to fuck her right off the counter.  things were going great, except i had yet to notice one of the dogs was standing in the kitchen barking every now and then at us (she was my wife's dog years before we met, and she is very protective).  things escalated and i picked her up and put her on the kitchen table... admit it, so far my lunch is going great, right?

well, that's when shit took a turn downhill.  as many of you know.. a good ol' fucking can sometimes sound pretty damn violent--especially when she is screaming.  i didn't think about it because hey, this is normal for us.. the dog thought differently and apparently assumed i was beating mommy.  after a few moments, the dog began barking more, then more, and then... the growl.  i heard it while it happened, but didn't realize it until it was too late.

all of the sudden i could not just hear the growl, but feel it... then, in a moment my ass wont forget for a while, i feel it.  she barks once, and then bites me full on, right on my left ass cheek.  

i instantly go limp dick, and the lunch fuck is ruined.  we got a good laugh out of it, but didn't get to finish as i had to go back to work by the time we cooled off from the incident.

222_2_2,"this happened a few hours ago. (on mobile so sorry for shit formatting and errors)

okay so i had an assignment draft due today. nothing big, just two pages but i decided i might as well staple it anyway, just in case it gets lost. 

i go to staple it and what do i find? my stapler is empty. no biggie, i'll just refill it. 

i go to close the stapler and my brilliant self thought it was a great idea to place my thumb where the staples come out. 

a few seconds later i feel a sharp pain on my thumb so i pull my hand away and with it comes the stapler. 

yes, friends. i stapled my thumb to the stapler. 

i lean over to my friend and quietly tell her that i have royally fucked myself and, being the good friend she is, she yells across the library to our teacher that i have stapled my thumb. 

my teacher comes over and immediately starts panicking because i have a stapler attached to my thumb. she sends my friend and another teacher with me to the nurse. 

half way there the stapler detaches itself but there is still a staple imbedded in my thumb. 

we get to the nurse and she starts laughing at the sheer  ridiculousness of the situation. she gives me a bandaid and some dettol and tells me to pull it out. 

i grab the staple and pull. immediately blood starts pouring out of the tiny holes because if how deep the staple had gone in. i wipe the blood away and put the bandaid on. 

the nurse gives me a note to show that i've been to her, on which she writes ""stapled finger"".  

i get back to my class and i glue the staple to the note because why not. then i decide to actually staple my assignment. i look through it to make sure everything is there and what do i find? the second page is blank. i didn't need to staple my assignment at all. 

this whole situation could have been avoided if i had just checked my work first.

i work at a huge waste disposal site, and i have the responsibility for all the hazardous waste that comes in. so today was just a regular day, sorting out all the hazardous waste like paint, oil, batteries etc. when i was done sorting everything out i took myself a well deserved break. 
so i was sitting in my chair casually reading the daily newspaper when suddenly the valve for the emergency fire hose exploded. apparently the water pressure had been on the entire time which ended flooding the entire station. there wasn't much i could do since the only person who knew where the main switch for the water supply was my boss. 

this is where everything went to shit. beneat the emergency fire hose was a huge fuse-box to power the entire station, well all i can is that it broke pretty damn fast. now my boss blamed me for not turning the pressure off which ended in me getting fired. so now i'm at home playing league of legends and listening to bruce springsteen.",3
226_2_2,"yesterday morning i was multitasking,

i put milk on the stove and then went 
to the bathroom to shave, which in itself is not a good idea.

while sitting on the toilet i was listening to my ipod classic and began
to put on a landing strip. approching take off i cut myself and propelled my ipod into the bowl, panicking i get up knocking my head against the mirror door.

so by this time i'm lying on the floor bleeding at multiple spots and confused as hell. after realizing what has happend i plan on getting my ipod and turning it off. easier said than done, grabbing it out of the bowl i notice that i got no idea how to accomplish this trivial seeming task.

sprinting to my laptop and getting blood everywhere i hold play on my ipod. nothing happens. i figure out that i have to hold play and center, wait for it to boot up fully(which is an eternity for apple products) and then turn it off. after 2 minutes or so i finally succeed. 

remember the milk from the beginning? well me neither. but my alarm did and comes screaming at me while i'm disinfecting nearly giving me a heart attack.

you'll probably like to know if the ipod is working.
it does, but it displays a firewire not plugged in message from time to time (which makes sense i guess, since firewire isn't plugged in)

anyways, because i'm also in a ldr, i really haven't felt the need to impress anyone at all so i've neglected to shave for probably ~6 weeks or so...which has resulted in a nicely fruitful amazon forest. i also just hate shaving and haven't had time.

because of this, i know for a fact the bath water is gonna be full of hair so i grab my cup and use it to rinse the shaver off with. alright, awesome. so i've shaved my legs, armpits, and tacobits and by now you can't even see the water in the cup, it's just a black mass of lady greenery. 

i continue on with the rest of my bath as normal, and then wash my face last. my eyes are closed because of said facial wash and as usual, i reach for my rinsing up. i think you already know where this is going. i thought to myself, oh the cup is already full of water awesome and proceed to dump it on my head.",1

i work in it, i should know better than to have a drink at my desk but well... it's a very casual work environment, and i was thirsty. not casual enough i can spray my desk with a few ounces of diet pepsi though, which happened just as loudly and violently as possible. 

my coworkers panic and think i'm gagging, so they all come over. i'm frantically trying to clean up before it touches any paperwork or fucks up my work computer. none of that's touched, but the 60$ apple keyboard i use is drenched. 

coworker asks whats wrong and without thinking i reply ""oh this stupid joke on..."" and it hits me. ""uhh... yeah just a joke i read. whatever, i'll go grab another keyboard.""

coworker: ""wow dude. wtf? that must be some joke. what is it?""

me: ""uhh...""

boss *approaching*: ""hey, what's the commotion?""

so were all happy to be back together all weekend and sunday turns immediately into an aggressive sunday-funday. grad school friend brings myself and another one of my friends around campus while the other part of the crew is re-upping at the liquor store.

its a beautiful campus, there's an amphitheater in a nice open area and, due to alcohol, we start using the amphitheater as a playground and start jumping around and just overall having a good time.

liquid confidence is very high at this point so i jump a gap in the amphitheater. nailed it. liquid confidence lvl: max. i see a trashcan near me among the same height as i am. so i go for it.

as i am flipping backwards and sideways, i realize that the trash can isn't bolted to the concrete square in the grassy area its standing on. i also realize its completely empty. i figure, if this goes bad i fall in the grass, say ow, and continue on with the day.

instead, i go straight right instead of any other direction, and meet the concrete sidewalk with the right side of my face, left wrist, and somehow sprained my left ankle.

further along the day i start getting more and more anxious and quite nauseous.when i get to work in the evening (fast food joint) i'm feeling really weird and pretty sick, as i'm working my hands are shaking all over like i've got parkinsons or something.
i'm feeling like shit by this point so i take a break and sit down at the back of the shop. right now i'm starting to lose feeling in my hands, legs and face and it's being replaced by this insane vibration. i feel like i'm going to fucking pass out. my whole body is oscillating and i think i'm going to die.

eventually my body stops vibrating, and after some water i settle down and take the night off. i still feel like i want to vomit but at least i'm not passed out. 

it turns out that i should have not only read the coffee packet for the *expiry date* but i should have also checked to see that it was really *instant coffee* (which you only really need use one teaspoon of, i probably had the equivalent of about 7 or 8 cups of coffee in one hit. my normal amount is about twice a month!)

237_2_2,"so, this happened about 8 years ago during my first shift working at mcdonald's (this was my first job as well). had to go into the cool room to get some frozen nuggets. had just watched dumb and dumber the night before and the frozen pole which was attached to the rack caught my attention. i remember watching the scene when harry gets his tongue on the frozen pole and thinking to myself ""that can't happen, your tongue would just come off"". anyway - put down the nuggets, made sure my tongue was really wet and ready to go and stuck it right on the pole. boy did it stick. after about 30 seconds of genuine panic and soft attempts to yank it off i whipped my head back and ripped my tongue free from the pole. blood everywhere and a little bit of my tongue attached on the pole i bolted out of the cool room, only to have my manager ask what the hell happened. unable to talk properly, i told her i slipped in the cool room and bit my tongue on the way down. she instantly sat me down, called my parents and i went home. next shift i came in and the big boss pulled me aside, paid for my lunch, asked me a series of questions and made sure that i was still happy working and that i wasn't angry at the store in any way. they also cleaned out the whole storage room and did a major clean up of the whole mcdonalds store which caused the store to close for a day. since the incident the boss and managers were always extremely nice to me (i now know it's because they were ensuring i didn't turn around a file a law suit against them for providing an unsafe work environment or something like that).",2

243_2_2,"to start the story i have to go back about a week. i got new box springs for my hand-me-down king size bed from the nebraska furniture warehouse. they tied the two twin box springs down after we waited an hour with rope and so we set on home. to make it fit in my room better i decided to clean, paint, and get rid of a giant desk. i took the desk apart and threw it in the back of the pickup. got the bed, slept great whatever. today about four days later i decided to go to the weight room. i grabbed the keys and set to the truck. when i was younger we weren't on top of the whole driving thing so here i am 17 and only have a permit deciding to drive. i get to the weight room and as soon as i pull into the parking spot i back up to readjust myself and hear a clank sound. i'm thinking the wood fell out; i go out to put it back in. there isn't any wood on the ground instead the exhaust pipe fell. i get one of my friends in the weight room and he says just make sure it isn't hitting the tire.  i call two other friends just to see if they could help. we look under there and the clamp that holds the tailpipe is twisted. so shit it's not fixable by me. my friend calls his more truck savvy dad but he is at work. so using rope that's still in the truck we kinda rig it up. i get it home and like a pussy i go to my friends house not worrying about it. at dq my brother gets a call. we go home, i lie then confess because i was fucked. i get grounded for 2 weeks and lose all trust. my brother is absolved of it because he did nothing but lie for me. apparently there was rope in the drive way and some wedged under the tool box in the bed. what happened was the rope from the week before got twisted the clamp some how and popped the exhaust pipe out. it's part bad luck part me just being a retard and not walking.",3.

a few moments later when the family dinner is a about to start i hear disturbing mumbling in the next room but didn't really think of it until i came home and my mom was in complete distress about a phone call from my father wanting to file a lawsuit against my mom........apparently my niece told my half-brother that ""auntie doesn't have a bed, she says she sleeps on a carpet"", he then told my father about it and my dad was so outraged thinking that his ex-wife (for some completely ridiculous reason) lets her daughter sleep on a carpet on the floor and wanted to have full custody over me that's why he called and told her he was gonna go to court about this

so to start i have three best friends. not going to name names but we have been friends through previous family connections for years. my mates birthday was friday and we bought alcohol as we have done for the rest of our birthdays this year. (we all turned the legal drinking age this year.) once we we're sufficiently stocked we headed back home to reminisce about stories of the past. a few hours and half a litre of alcohol later is where i can no longer tell the story from my point of view. according to my friends i collapsed. being inebriated they panick and load me into their car. they drove down the road open the door and push me out infront of a house. as i lay on the lawn the owners of the home noticed i was lying in their yard. not sure if i was alive or dead they called 911 immediately. i was then rushed to hospital and immediately put on a ventelator. the hanting detail is at 2 am my mom had text me asking when im coming home. two minutes before i was thought to be in a coma by hospital staff. i cant say what else happened until the time i woke up at 5:36 am. later my mother told me i was 1-2 drinks away from slipping into a coma as my bac was a 0.36. the reason i posted this was to warn people to drink responsibility. i didnt even feel too drunk during this time. remember how precious life is.

over the past few years her mobility and health has declined.  we wanted to make sure we got plenty of pictures of her along with the stunning scenery that would make almost anyone on /r/earthporn bust a nut.  

anyways, over the course of two weeks i took many pictures.  a lot of them my grandmother wasn't able to see at the time due to mobility, temperature/weather, or activity schedule.  

about a week after returning back home i decided it was time to start uploading the photos for the rest of the family to see.  this is where i fuck up.  i put the sd card into my computer to transfer the pictures.  a box appears saying that the sd card was not recognized.  i tried other sd cards and they all worked fine.  so i tried again and dropbox had an option to start transferring.  i went to click no but accidentally hit the button allowing the transfer.  sd card was wiped clear but the photos failed to load into dropbox.  the only remaining evidence that the photos existed is a folder in dropbox titled ""camera uploads (selective sync conflict)"".

when we were sitting in the airport on our layover back from london in germany, the person at the desk called for me to come to the desk on the speaker. they then proceeded to bring me into a room where multiple soldiers were with guns drawn and ready and my checked bag on the ground in the middle. they asked me to go through it and confused and shaky, i went through the bag. i then realized that the grenade was there and that i was in a potentially terrible situation. i explained to them what it was and they to prove it by pulling the pin. while this confused me because this seemed like a terrible decision on their part, yet there were soldiers with guns out around me, i confidently pulled the pin of the grenade, it didn't explode. now every time i fly my checked bag is subject to ""random searches,"" as they tell me.  the best part is that the grenade wasn't caught in london but actually later in germany.",3

a few weeks ago i got a call from a particularly drunken and high z who wanted to do themselves in so i spent that night making sure they were okay. despite some very weird goings on where they were angrily responding to comments that no one had said. due to their unhealthy state.

after that night, everything was perfectly fine until 3 weeks later when this sentence was said ""i will always appreciate you. you are one of the best people i know... i fucking hate you! you are a prick. i hope you die!"" and they ran off. now nothing happened between the two things and i hadn't even had a chance to respond to the first comment.

over the next few days people started learning why she suddenly hated me. when i eventually found out what the story is, i can assure you that it is a very alternative take on what i did that evening. but it does tie in with the ""weird goings on"" i mentioned. now because of the way they have been acting it would appear that they believe this completely so i just tried to ignore everything as much as possible and leave it alone. but after a few too many comments, i said ""i am not going to go into what happened but you can guarantee it didn't happen that way. i don't know why they are saying it, maybe it is because of the alcohol."" i decided not go into the details because i know that that would be better for z. and i am beginning to realise that i can handle this better than they would.

we arrived at the airport with 2 hours to spare thankfully, but when it came to tsa checking our ids i didn't have mine. after a discussion with one of the officers they told me they would let me through but i had to answer a bunch of personal questions to make sure i was who i said i was, despite my picture being on my dad's credit card and the fact that i look almost identical to him. 

it took about an hour to get through security and i was able to make the flight. however, i was warned by tsa they can only do this kind of once. this is a problem since i also had to fly back from florida after the vacation. 

we have our fun in florida at universal studios and disneyworld but the time came to go back home. we went to the airport and were met again with the id issue. the officer i talked to was nice enough to let me do the identification again, but told me i was put on a list at homeland security and would be detained if i ever tried to fly without an id again.",3

(weird saying, huh?) anyway, met the family and some new friends and had a good time. 

now, it turns out there was a plan to get me initiated as it was my first polish easter. basically at midnight on the sunday night/monday morning, they throw water over everybody. so at midnight, everybody got a mug of water and waited to throw it at me as i was the newbie. we were already standing outside chatting and i had no clue what was going on, i thought they were just getting a drink. at midnight, they all threw it at once. i was soaked. pretty funny though!

anyway, that's not the fuck up. as i didn't know and i hadn't wet anybody myself, one of the guys who i've met a few times before said i could throw water at him as he was last for this to happen to on a previous year and he wanted me to be involved. so i was given a mug of water and i threw it at him. however, my hand was wet from being soaked and i wasn't holding the mug by the handle. so i ended up throwing the whole fucking mug by accident. the shot was perfect. for his face. fuck. bruise on his nose. 

he was a bit startled but took it well though. he said it and he was okay, and i apologised profusely but everyone said don't worry, it's a new story to tell people. he might have a headache this morning though... 

in case you were worried about the mug, it didn't break. it fell straight on to concrete and somehow just rolled... crazy physics.

388_2_3,"greetings! younger reddit browser here to share a story from a day or two ago.

midterms were amongst us, and on this particular day i had my physical education course's exam. the exam was made up of three parts, all under a [pacing program]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5vvroplaw4&feature=youtube_gdata_player): running (linked), push ups, and curl ups. this story revolves around the curl ups.

my friend and i had just returned from doing the push up test, and has decided to get the other ""easy"" test out of the way.  we were part of the last group of people to go up at that time.

after minutes of anticipation, we get set up to start the test.

""we begin in three... two... [beep]""

i lift myself up from the mat, to feel a very distinctive rumble in my nether regions.

*oh, fuck no.*

at a very young age, i thought i had the ability to perform ""automatic farts"" (that's a story for another time; i was one of the weird but kind of cool kids), and would always be quite the entertainment source for friends and family members. until a later age, i never realized i was, in fact, performing queefs. from the years of doing this, i gained quite the exquisite muscle ability in these regions. with such power, it sometimes became abit... uncontrollable.

the muscle contractions from performing these curl ups were causing me to queef.

i was, luckily, saved by the blaring speakers placed right next to my testing mat. but i fear a couple were quite audible- considering the look on one of the coaches faces whilst i was leaving the test area.

i do not have this teacher, but who knows if he'll keep this to himself.

i do not plan on performing curl ups again soon.",2

back to me(not moe). 

at this point, i walk up to the starbucks with my mate and see our panini devouring buddy sat at a table, staring directly across with a rather angry saudi man standing next to him. we notice his gaze is fixed. his body and head may be moving, but his eyes haven't. as he snaps out of his trance, the saudi man takes off one of his slippers and starts beating our friend with it. bart and i burst out laughing. moe's always getting himself into trouble. we wonder what he's done. we walk up to the table to try to calm down a livid saudi man, and then we hear moe say ""but sir, really, i don't even like boobs. i would never! i'm not that kind of guy"" this went on back and forth, moe ended up explaining to the rest of the patrons at the starbucks that he really wasn't a pervert and we were asked to leave otherwise they would inform the authorities.

turns out, moe was so lost in his own world, he failed to notice the saudi family sit at the table right there and he failed to notice how uncomfortable he was making the woman by staring right at her chest and failed to notice the saudi man repeatedly warning him to stop.",1. Not guilty
391_2_3,"so this happened yesterday.

so i have to give you guys some background, my family is not rich, we have are struggles but sometimes we don't it's complicated, my dad bought me these raybans that i had been asking for and they were around $300. now i have never spent $300 in anything just like that usually we finance so i was pretty surprised when my dad did that. now back to the story, yesterday i was having a pretty bad day because i did not have anything to wear to a party because all the clothes that i had were not formal. so i was sad as shit sitting in the bathroom taking a shit and i put my glasses on the ground. now i'm mostly blind without my glasses and prior to sitting in the bathroom i told my sister if she could iron my shirt and she agreed so i was sitting their shirtless and blind when my sister knocked on the door to tell me she was done ironing. i got up and fucking stepped on these expensive ass pieces of shit right in front of me and then i dropped water all over the bathroom. now i am sitting here fixing my glasses that have cracks and too scared to tell anyone because my dad spent so much money on them.",3
392_2_3,"so i live next to my parents, in the country so my family is close by. my gf was over so we decided to wrestle/cuddle. she was on my lap pinning me down and it looked like we were having sexy time. i'm 16 and that's when my grandma came in. i ate taco bell and a prune smoothie, it wasn't sitting very well and when she came in, i panicked and shit my self. it wasn't normal shit it was taco-bell-smoothie shit. it stained the white sheets and now my gf isn't talking to me.

 

update
     my grandmother knows we weren't but she noticed i shit my self
no pics, i tried to clean myself before taking a pic",2
395_2_3,"so i'm visiting my grandparents and uncle today for a sort of nice family get-together. they live downtown in a fairly small appartment; about 3 rooms, a kitchen, and a bathroom. 
the problem is, i had eaten two entire buckets of extremely spicey buffalo wild wings, and had to drop a massive care package about an hour into the visit. i saw that the bathroom was very close to the dining room, in which we were all sitting and enjoying some nice apple pie. i planned on holding it until after the meal, but the oncoming storm of chocolate rain refused to be held back. 
i excuse myself from the table and sit on the can. not a second later the brown waterfall begins splashing into the water, accompanied by sounds which i never thought my stimach would be capable of making. this continued for roughly 25 minutes, with short pauses in between the torrential shitstorms. i could hear the sounds of fidgeting and discomfort coming from the other room, and by the end i felt embarrassed but extremely relieved. 
i am currently sitting in the living room and trying to make conversation, after having to clean my watery shit off of the inside of the toilet as the water could only take down at most 1/3 of it. 

but the moral of the story is, a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.",1. Not guilty
397_2_3,"okay let's set the scene. i was about halfway through my shift at a popular fast food chain (kfc) in southern sydney. so the time is around 7:45 pm on a monday night and there about 5 people total, working including a cook and the manager. so anyway this lady comes in and orders her food which is one of those big family meals you normally get at fast food places. the other person working at the front counter and i start preparing her meal and start taking other orders because there is a queue of other people waiting for their food. when we finally hand over her food she starts to get angry and says ""took your time didn't you."" in the rudest tone she could muster. as she turns off and walks out she says ""this is probably the f***ing slowest kfc that i've been to."" just as she is about to exit the building i say to myself under my breath (in hindsight probably not the best thing to do) ""if that's your opinion."" oh boy did i release the floodgates. the lady comes back and demands to speak to my manager using many swear words and calling me not so nice (probably deserved) names. the manager then comes over to help defuse the situation and then she starts ripping into him. he then gives her a free 1.25 litre drink to shut her up and she still keeps going on and on. these two builders that were waiting for their food then start ripping into her causing her to storm out of the store saying she will never eat at our kfc again. after all this subsides i'm pulled aside by the manager and he says i'm going to have to talk to the store manager on my next shift which i am not looking forward to.",2. Slightly guilty
399_2_3,"this happened when i was 8 years old. a few family friends came to stay at our place for a few days. this meant for me that my room would be taken by one of them and i would be sleeping on a mattress in my parents room.

now for the fuck-up. i was getting out of the shower one night. my room is right outside the bathroom, so i would usually walk to my room naked. i proceeded as normal, went to open the door and...

a 20-something year old female woman was sitting at my desk. even worse, she turned around to look who came in. rest assured, i got the fuck out of there.",2
400_2_3,"i work in a community pool and teach swimming lessons as well as do some lifeguarding. every 15 minutes or so i get a 5 minute break, as my coworkers and i rotate positions. so my break time had come up, and there hadn't been a public swim for atleast 30 minutes so i assumed  most people who had come, had changed and left. i was very. very wrong.  

in the pool, the only toilets are in the change rooms, and when i need to go i usually go into the family changing room because it is much closer, cleaner and usually there is nobody in it. so my break came up and i went to go do my business when i get to the door i notice it is wide open, i don't hear any noises, and everybody who had come for a swim should have been gone already, so i don't bother yelling into the room just to check. this is where i fucked up. i stroll on in and as i turn the corner after the door, there facing right at me is a 100% buck naked old woman with no nearby towel. she saw me and tried to hide behind one of the benches yelling, as i immediately got out of there as fast as humanly possible saying that i was sorry. the image shall be forever ingrained in my brain. the silhouette of her saggy boobs...  the thought brings back trauma.  who the  fuck leaves a door open and unlocked in a community center.... by definition there are going to be people around. i will never enter a public room again without loudly announcing myself ever again.",3
401_2_3,"so this just happened and i am dreading coming home tonight. 

my boyfriend sent me a 5 minute voicemail saying how awesome i was and just generally goofing off. i laughed my head off and i wanted to save that voicemail so i could send it back to him. so i saved the voicemail and then tried to forward it to my bf. i wasn't paying attention to what i was doing and instead of forwarding the message to my bf, i sent it to my dad. 

this is extra awkward since i am also a guy and am not out to my family. 

tonight's dinner will be awkward!",3
